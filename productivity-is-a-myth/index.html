<p>Productivity is dependent on and interwoven with so many things that anytime anyone pushes "more productive" I wonder...</p>
<p>If you're "productive" and you get 3 things done in a day, or in a week even...</p>
<h3 id="the-many-measures-of-productivity">The Many Measures of Productivity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Were the 3 things done actually the important ones? <em>(i.e. do they create <strong>value</strong>? reduce drag or improve velocity?)</em></li>
<li>How are you able to actually measure the effect/impact of the 3 things?  Against what baseline and over what time period?</li>
<li>Do those 3 things even matter if the market suddenly shifted away from your product/segment/industry?</li>
<li>Do they contradict previous features/changes? <em>(i.e. did they create confusion rather than clarity?)</em></li>
<li>Were 3 things being compared to 1, or were they being compared to 30? <em>(If <strong>expectations</strong> aren't correctly set and met you cannot ever be "productive")</em></li>
<li>Does anybody even know that you did those 3 things? <em>("if a tree falls..." and "success has many fathers")</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hidden-costs">Hidden Costs</h3>
<p>When getting 3 things "done", did you ignore the cost of quality?</p>
<ol>
<li>Does it actually solve the intended problem?</li>
<li>Are there unacceptable side effects or regressions?</li>
<li>Do you even want to know the answers to the previous two questions?</li>
</ol>
<p>Without test automation you probably have a feature or code that cannot be validated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How will this value persist when the next bug fix or refactor occurs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With code that is <strong>unreadable</strong> and therefore unmaintainable:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Will the next developer be unable to fix a bug or maybe just removes the code entirely?</li>
<li>Will you be unable to grow your organization as you cannot find anyone to work on your codebase anymore?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Did these changes dramatically increase the <strong>complexity</strong> of the architecture or the product?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>spaghetti-ball-of-mud-rube-goldberg-birth-of-a-blackhole?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was this "done" at the expense of <strong>burnout</strong> of an individual or the team?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who will continue development of the feature or product?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do these changes affect operational complexity or cost?  Does crashing often or going <strong>bankrupt faster</strong> count as productivity?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this just squeezing the complexity bubble or shifting the burden?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In "getting things done" did you <strong>burn bridges</strong> within your organization? What about partners or existing customers?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you make a small subset happier at the expense of a much larger group?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about the future, did you just trade loyal customers for a new ephemeral cohort?</p>

<p><em>Most Valuable</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things become more valuable as they become more real</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(becoming widely distributed/adopted for more people is a kind of proof that it actually solves a problem)</em></p>
<h3 id="traditional-methods-of-productivity">Traditional Methods of Productivity</h3>
<p>There are amazing methods and techniques to "sustainably" and reliably create the "right thing" that is the "tipping point feature" of a "killer app" where you can measure and watch your key metrics and indicators go "up and to the right".</p>
<p>"Everyone loves a winner" and survivor bias certainly helps but...</p>
<p>The simplest way, in our capitalism-with-money-as-a-fungible-intermediary, is to receive dollars. :$</p>
<p>Yup, very crass, and a "lagging indicator" that is not nearly as exciting as "clicks" or "eyeballs" or "MAU/DAU/HAU", but...
<em>Monthly Active Users, Daily Active Users, Hourly Active Users, etc.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you get people to part with their money you have definitely convinced them of <strong>some value</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations that have lasted longer, with the same people in them, are more likely the ones that have figured out a process for delivering value.</p>
<p>But maybe, instead of focusing on being productive, you should figure out how to get old and rich. =p</p>
<h3 id="doing-something-different">Doing Something Different</h3>
<p>While imitation is the sincerest form of attempting to copy someone else's financial success, competition in a "race to the bottom" can turn a "win-win" into a "zero-sum" and then a "lose-lose".</p>
<p>Productivity should therefore also be compared against not only "what-is" but the "not-yet-imagined".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strategy is creating <strong>a rising tide</strong> that lifts all boats.  Tactics is poking holes in other people's stuff</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So go on then, be productive! =)</strong></p>
