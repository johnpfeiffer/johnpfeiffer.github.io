<p>...If you can't see the bulbs from the switch room, how can you tell which connects to which if you can only enter the bulb room once?</p>
<p>Flip the first switch for one bulb for many minutes, then turn it off.</p>
<p>Flip the second switch on. Enter the bulb room, the bulb on connects to the second switch, the warmer of the two bulbs off is the first switch.  </p>

<p><strong>...that can only support 2 people at a time and they have only one flashlight.</strong></p>
<p>If each were alone here's how fast they could cross: the first in 15 minutes, the second in 10 minutes, the third in 2 minutes and the fourth in 1 minute. </p>
<p>If the flashlight only has 17 minutes how do they cross?</p>
<ol>
<li>The 1 minute and 2 minute cross together (takes 2 minutes). </li>
<li>The 1 minute returns (total is now 3 minutes). </li>
<li>The 10 and 5 minutes cross together (total is now 13 minutes). </li>
<li>The 2 minute returns (the total is now 15 minutes). </li>

<h4 id="3-bags-contain-all-oranges-all-apples-or-a-mix-of-oranges-and-apples">3 bags contain all oranges, all apples, or a mix of oranges and apples...</h4>
<p><strong>...BUT the label on each definitely is incorrect. How do you find out which bag has what and how many bags to you need to open?</strong></p>
<p><em>Choose the one labeled "mixed" and if it contains apples, therefore the remaining bag which is labelled oranges must not contain all oranges and so must be the mixed one.</em></p>
<h4 id="there-are-3-red-hats-and-2-blue-hats-in-a-bag">There are 3 red hats and 2 blue hats in a bag....</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew, Bob, and Carol each reach into the box and place one of the hats on their own head.
They cannot see what color hat they have chosen.
Then they sit down all facing in the same direction: Andrew &lt;-- Bob &lt;--Carol</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Such that Carol can see what color Bob and Andrew are wearing. </li>
<li>Bob can see what color Andrew is wearing. </li>
<li>Andrew can't see anyone's hats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The first person to say what color hat they are wearing wins.</strong> 
The winner of the game gets a billion dollars... But if they guess wrong, they die... so nobody wants to try "just guessing"...</p>
<p>SO... after they grab their hats and sit down, a long time passes...</p>
<p>Eventually somebody says "I have the answer" and successfully states what color hat they have.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Since Carol can see Andrew and Bob, if they both were wearing blue hats she would immediately know that she was wearing red, so unlikely that a long time would pass before she answered (and take the money)...</li>
<li>Therefore Andrew and Bob have one red hat and one blue hat. (And Carol knows there's a 33% chance she's got a blue hat and a 66% chance she's got a red hat).</li>
<li>Since Bob knows that Carol delayed in answering "a long time passes" AND he can see the color of hat that Andrew is wearing, then</li>
<li>Either Andrew is wearing a blue hat, and therefore Bob must be wearing a red hat.  </li>
<li>Or Andrew is wearing a red hat, and therefore Bob must be wearing a blue hat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bob successfully answers...</p>
<p><em>(unless Carol is more interested in sadistic plots and even though she knows both Bob and Andrew have blue hats she just waits to watch Bob get it wrong...)</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>NOTE: this variation from the NY Times is slightly incorrect as it is essentially asking why Andrew wins... 
The clue in order for "Andrew" to know (the delay) is the same as what Bob uses, but Bob will be able to deduce it much faster. 
(Again, Carol could be deliberately waiting to watch Andrew fail too...)

<p>If the 3 vs 3 do not match then take two of the heavy side and weigh
them against each other: if they're unequal you have the heavier one, if
they're equal then the last of the heavy side is the heavy one.<br/>

<em>Weigh 4 vs 4, label them ABCD and EFGH. If they balance then weigh
"good" ABC against WXY. If the second weighing balances then weigh Z
against A to see if Z is light or heavy. If the second weighing has WXY
heavier or lighter (make a note of which as we have solved whether the
imbalance is heavy or light), then weigh W with X. If they balance then
Y is the imbalance from step 2 (heavier or lighter). If they do not
balance then whichever matches the imbalance from step 2 is the off
ball.</em>

<p>IF at the first weighing ABCD was lighter than EFGH, in the second
weighing rotate such that ABCZ is weighed against D with "good" XYZ. If

<p>Note that this problem can also be solved by carefully measuring the
results as the left and right groups of 4 are rotated.</p>

<p>12 becomes 4 v 4 v (4) - if the balance the last 4 are easy  </p>
<p>if not balanced: 1,2,5 vs 3,6,12</p>
