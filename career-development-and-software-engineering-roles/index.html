<h2 id="career-development-is-vague-but-heavy">Career Development is Vague but Heavy</h2>
<p>It can be vague where someone's career was before they met you and how <strong>they</strong> view their long term ambitions.</p>
<p>And when the work is getting done <strong>now</strong> it is easy to understand why <strong>future</strong> Career Development is one of the overlooked aspects of management.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers have a lot of job choices: if their current trajectory won't help them meet their life goals they will make changes that may come as an unwelcome surprise to their manager or organization.</p>
<p>Aligned interests, beyond salary-for-output <em>(it would be even better if it was compensation-for-outcome)</em>, is one of the simpler ways to improve a product and reduce the costs of turnover. <em>(i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams</a>)</em></p>
<h3 id="when-to-discuss-career-development">When to discuss Career Development</h3>
<p>One of the best tools for building relationships are 1:1's.
<em>("Manager Tools" <a href="https://files.manager-tools.com/files/public/product-samples/One_on_One_Shownotes_0.pdf">https://files.manager-tools.com/files/public/product-samples/One_on_One_Shownotes_0.pdf</a>)</em></p>
<p>At least once a quarter <em>(aka 3 months)</em> a 1:1 session should cover Career Development. <em>(i.e. a regular opportunity to align Company/Team Objectives or Goals with the individual's career)</em></p>
<p>One of the first questions I generally ask is <code>"Where do you want to be in 2 years?"</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 years is just long enough to be aspirational but near enough we should be planning together how to get there</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Where" should not be reductively just about salary, instead it should encompass talent + experience + direction.</em></p>
<p>As a caveat, even the largest companies will not have every type of role possible.
A good manager will provide guidance about what is immediately available (and research future possibilities).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great managers grow careers even when it means the outcome will be an individual changing teams or organizations</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="an-incomplete-list-of-technology-roles">An incomplete list of technology roles</h2>
<p>There are too many roles related to technology to list them all but here are some important ones...</p>
<h3 id="software-engineer">Software Engineer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front End Engineer</strong>: works mostly with implementing UserInterface features and bug fixes <em>(frequently using Javascript and including HTML and CSS)</em></li>
<li><strong>Mobile Engineer</strong>: sort of a specialist "front end engineer" (assuming you agree that the focus is on Users), ideally experience with both iOS and Android but usually specializes in one</li>
<li><strong>Fullstack Engineer</strong>: someone who can write/fix "front end" and "back end" code, often a generalist given the necessity of context switching between so many frameworks</li>
<li><strong>Backend Engineer</strong>: specializing in APIs, Services, and often data storage (i.e. databases, files, etc.) - by contrast less focus directly on Users</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Web Engineer is a less common title as there is less need to distinguish from a Desktop Engineer =p</em></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="software-engineering-gradations-by-years-of-experience">Software Engineering gradations by years of experience</h4>
<p>These levels/titles are really fuzzy because the years may more directly relate to time in an organization or specifically to a framework/techstack.</p>
<p><em>Also, with talent and extreme focus/specialization someone within 2 years can be producing at the level of a "principal engineer"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Junior</strong> <em>(&lt;2 years)</em>: focused on implementation under supervision</li>
<li><strong>Senior</strong> <em>(~between 2 and 5 years)</em>: able to independently gather requirements and run a project from start to finish</li>
<li><strong>Principal</strong> <em>(&gt;5 years)</em>: influence at the organizational level</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally it gets exponentially harder to "level up" <em>(it would be exceedingly rare to have an organization that is all principal engineers)</em>. Interestingly, given the investment in time, training, and supervision required for junior engineers, it is also rare to have a "pyramid" shaped engineering organization.</p>
<p><em>One caveat: a Software Engineer will apply best practices in creating solutions and systems (i.e. bigger picture complexity and scale), whereas a Programmer title hints at a more "limited to code" role.</em></p>
<h5 id="example-diagram-of-engineering-levels">Example Diagram of Engineering Levels</h5>
<p><img alt="An example diagram of engineering career levels" src="../images/engineering-levels-layered-framework.png"/></p>
<h3 id="operations">Operations</h3>
<p>Technology roles supporting the actual running of software and services...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SiteReliabilityEngineers (SRE)</strong>: automating monitoring and stability as applied expertise via code <em>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering</a>)</em></li>
<li><strong>DevOps</strong>: automating the operations of systems and services (including monitoring, scripts and code writing, etc.) - leverages Dev skills with Ops experience <em>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps</a>)</em></li>
<li><strong>Operations</strong>: maintaining services/systems (hopefully still using automation and ideally transitioning to DevOps due to increased scale)</li>
<li><strong>System Administrator</strong>: manual job of maintaining a small number of (virtual or physical) machines/systems</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>Information has to be stored somewhere, this specialization has become even more prevalent with the exponential growth of "big data"...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Scientist</strong>: someone who uses mathematical tools like statistics, in conjunction with software and "big data", to answer questions <em>(or discover insights)</em></li>
<li><strong>Data Engineer</strong>: someone who builds infrastructure and tools that enables "Data Science", i.e. pipelines, warehouses</li>
<li><strong>DBA (Database Administrator)</strong>: someone who manages the data for an organization, often an expert in the tooling and optimization</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="lateral-moves">Lateral Moves</h2>
<p>Sometimes, besides all the levels and specializations, there are changes in career track <em>(significantly different responsibilities and focus)</em> that are big enough to be called a "lateral move".</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Architect</strong>: larger systems are inherently complex and designing and communicating the interfaces, especially across multiple teams/services, is an essential "big picture" role</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Having eng experiences leads to designs with fast and effective implementations and prevents "ivory tower"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering Manager</strong>: people are non-deterministic, they cannot be debugged, and yet they are a part of every successful organization.
Someone who takes care of people, helps build and keep a team running smoothly, and achieves company outcomes. This is usually the role before Director and VP</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Having eng experience vastly increases credibility and the ability to estimate and deliver</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: someone who methodically thinks outside the box and regularly breaks boxes, ideally the most valuable boxes first</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Having eng experience means awareness of common shortcomings in frameworks/code and certain boundary conditions or real world scenarios (i.e. load)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: someone who thinks way outside of the box and finds ways to get inside of locked boxes</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Having eng experience allows for familiarity with architecture/framework/code flaws and automation of exploits</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product Manager</strong>: someone with passion and organizational skills who drives a product forward into the world</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Having eng experience allows for clearer and faster scope/timing discussions, and the ability to help the team with design or debugging</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Designer</strong>: someone who loves the User and UI/UX and delivers highly desirable features and products</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Having eng experience allows for more effective collaboration and reduced time to market</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-important-aspects">Other Important Aspects</h2>
<p>Career Development is not just getting the next position, it should also be about a lot of qualitative skills that lead to success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listening</strong>: hearing Users, Stakeholders, Teammates, etc. is one of the most important parts of solving the right problems</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: proposing good solutions, asking hard questions, raising concerns, writing skills</li>
<li><strong>Time Management</strong>: individual deadlines, team success</li>
<li><strong>Interviewing</strong>: being an interviewer is a completely different specialization - yet hiring cannot succeed without good technical interviewers</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong>: understanding impact and the consequences of outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>: multiplying the efforts of those around you</li>
</ul>
<p>For each skill it is worth considering:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the individual's current level?</li>
<li>How important is it to them to improve?</li>
<li>What resources can be provided?</li>
<li>How will they be encouraged and held accountable for progress?</li>
</ol>
<p>Did I miss something? Are there missing nuances or outright incorrect statements?  Of course! =)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all definition to this NP-Hard problem of "people and organizations over time"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My brash/blunt style is apparent in this article, but for a peek at how much better things get with collaboration and an editor check out the polished version:</p>
