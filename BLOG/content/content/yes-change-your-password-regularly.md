Security is risk management: the hundreds of articles about "changing
passwords doesn't improve security" are just hype/noise without context.

</p>

While "changing the highly complex password every 90 days" is considered
inefficient and draconian... But what about changing the password once a
year?

</p>

While it's likely that an external attacker or disgruntled employee will
use a compromised password immediately, it doesn't mean there isn't a
good reason to choose a frequency of password change:

</p>

If a sticky note attached to a laptop sold at a garage sale is still
valid for the company's online bank account then you're in trouble.

</p>

Reduce the risk, have a policy to manage that window of access to
something you're comfortable with.

</p>

Plus, Dependency Visibility and the opportunity to improve your
infrastructure is well worth the cost of finding every hard coded place
that a password is embedded in your organization (e.g. you know that you
just changed the password and you quickly find something not working as
opposed to a random event like a forgotten password reset by one
individual in the organization that creates a mystery problem in mission
critical systems for IT to track down).
