Let's start with a problem... (rather than technology looking for a problem ;) Getting the weather can be frustrating which of the 6+ websites would you choose? how many annoying ads? why does one show the city first, another shows daily temperature, and a third jumps to the week ahead? It can take many clicks to view a specific city that you're interested in... And many prompts to \"sign up as a user\" or \"subscribe aka pay money\" to have your view of the weather customized So pay for a weather app - that still doesn't do what you want? Or find a weather API, write your own app/website, just the way you want it: \"5 day forecast of days and nights - temperatures in both F and C How useful is your toilet without the plumbing? LLMs (Large Language Models) excel at natural language processing (NLP) - like asking the computer about the weather (typos and all!) But the LLM doesn't have access to up to date info (weather, prices) or private data (emails, databases). Model Context Protocol is a way to solve multiple things: A user would like the LLM to utilize newer or specific info Each LLM vendor has a \"custom way to configure\" With multiple LLM applications running locally... and you have a lot of tools Organizations want a centralized way to control access to tools and (potentially private) information Therefore this is an \"N x M\" problem: N (LLM) applications for M tools The grand vision: LLM vendors have a standard way to give users more leverage/capabilities Developers can build these \"MCP Servers\" once - and support every LLM product Organizations can centralize and manage all the LLMs accessing a given capability or dataset Users have far more powerful tools with very little setup Pre-Requisites Install the python dependency manager curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh Or for MacOS brew install uv background: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ Create a default project from a built in template with uv: uv init mcp-server-demo This creates a very minimal package (dependency) management configuration file - https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/ [project] name = \"mcp-server-demo\" version = \"0.1.0\" description = \"Add your description here\" readme = \"README.md\" requires-python = \">=3.13\" dependencies = [] you can ignore or remove the extraneous .gitignore, .git, README.md files Remove (delete) main.py as it is extraneous for this project. Next create a python virtual environment and activate it, and install dependencies: - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html cd mcp-server-demo uv venv source .venv/bin/activate uv add \"mcp[cli]\" httpx The code Use a coding editor to create weather.py that queries the national weather service and provides the MCP hook: from typing import Any import httpx from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP mcp = FastMCP ( \"weather\" ) NWS_API_BASE = \"https://api.weather.gov\" USER_AGENT = \"weather-app/1.0\" async def make_nws_request ( url : str ) -> dict [ str , Any ] | None : headers = { \"User-Agent\" : USER_AGENT , \"Accept\" : \"application/geo+json\" } async with httpx .

The LLM decides it can use the \"weather\" tool to help answer the question It actually prompts at first to to approve the permissions: Claude wants to use Get Forecast from weather The LLM has geographic data in its training and can use it's \"super distilled storage\" to convert a city name to coordinates Reques t { `la t i tu de` : 37.7749 , `lo n gi tu de` : -122.4194 } The LLM (MCP Host) is the client which communicates via JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout with the \"MCP weather server\" The (local) MCP weather server makes HTTP requests to the National Weather Service API The forecast data (JSON) is returned from the MCP Server to the \"MCP Host\" The LLM (MCP Host) incorporates and reformats the JSON into a natural language response https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol Last thoughts Adding tools to an LLM further extends the leverage already available with amazing default NLP that has fact sets and token generation. Capabilities like \"current weather\" can be added in a straightforward manner. MCP unlocks current data, private data, specialized tools, or even running a machine in the physical world - bridging the many fragmented and distinct APIs and interfaces Bonus Content You can directly see what the National Weather Service API returns curl https://api.weather.gov/points/37.780,-122.420 interestingly lat,lon are converted into \"grids\" which each local forecast office uses, so the JSON returns \"Daly City\" or \"Sausalito\" https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lon=-122.4192&lat=37.7793 Send JSON RPC in bash uv run weather.py << 'EOF' heredoc> { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"method\" : \"initialize\" , \"params\" : { \"protocolVersion\" : \"2024-11-05\" , \"capabilities\" : {}, \"clientInfo\" : { \"name\" : \"test\" , \"version\" : \"1.0\" }}, \"id\" : 1 } EOF A response { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 1 , \"result\" :{ \"protocolVersion\" : \"2024-11-05\" , \"capabilities\" :{ \"experimental\" :{}, \"prompts\" :{ \"listChanged\" : false }, \"resources\" :{ \"subscribe\" : false , \"listChanged\" : false }, \"tools\" :{ \"listChanged\" : false }}, \"serverInfo\" :{ \"name\" : \"weather\" , \"version\" : \"1.17.0\" }}}","tags":"ai","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/intro-to-mcp-give-your-llm-tools-with-model-context-protocol/"},{"title":"Maximum leverage and Minimum Ops with Google Cloud Run and the Jules Coding Agent","text":"Why Software Agents are Eating the World Software scales to infinity and prints money the whole way. Once the cost of distribution went to zero the dominant constraint on growth stopped being infrastructure and became people: how fast could humans design, write, deploy (and maintain!) software. Over 30+ years, to get increasing leverage (less humans!) and take advantage of economic specialization... Self-hosted physical servers became leasing space and energy/cooling with colocation \"Colos\" physical servers became leasing virtual machines Overprovisioned VMs became renting \"cloud servers\" Cloud services became pay by the millisecond \"serverless\" A remaining bottleneck: humans to write and maintain the code. LLM Coding Agents is \"software that writes software\" Personal Goal of Efficiency Physical wires and failing components, maintaining operating systems (security!), copying files and manually checking if the software even works at all... and even yak shaving down the rabbit hole of code syntax, dependency updates, edge cases, and content typos Over the years I have leveraged increasing levels of abstractions for provisioning the Environment and Infrastructure (IaaC), and for publishing Content/Code (git to production), all to increase cognitive focus and impact. see my previous articles on Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Docker, Static websites, Heroku, AWS, Google App Engine, and AWS Lambdas Try it for yourself: tell an LLM what you want and asynchronously it comes back (like any remote virtual colleague) with the changes - approve and voila it's live in seconds. Another day another cloud The goal is to give the LLM agent Jules instructions in english and go from git to production in seconds. Previously I have used Google App Engine but it seems to have been superseded by Google Cloud Run (and hopefully less byzantine IAM permissions and \"Artifact Registry\" costs) Google Cloud Run \"free tier\" is still confusing to estimate and calculate (charged by the millisecond) but should \"just run\". So here's how to setup a golang web server automatically built and deployed from each GitHub commit. Note: apparently Cloud Run also uses Artifact Registry to automatically leverage a Docker image that presumably if deployed enough times could go beyond the free tier :( Different day same Code If the web server starts automatically on port 8080 then it is \"Cloud Run Compatible\" https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/aws-go-lambda Their official example https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-go Google is project-centric Then navigate to a project (or make a new one) https://console.cloud.google.com/run/overview?project=go-cache \"Deploy a web service\" -> Connect repository Configuration GitHub: \"Continuously deploy from a repository (source or function)\" (this works for languages supported by Google) Cloud Build: Can deploy from GitHub repositories. \"Set up with Cloud Build\" (button) Source repository: GitHub Currently not authenticated, Authenticate You will be asked to authorize the Google Cloud Build GitHub App to access your GitHub Account to proceed. creates a pop up (check your blockers!): \"Authorize Google Cloud Build\" Repository: Manage connected repositories creates a pop up to GitHub (simplified integration and authentication/authorization) Only select repositories (choose from the dropdown) legalese checkbox Build Configuration Branch: &#94;main$ Build Type: Go (or Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP) nothing special for Build context, Entrypoint, or Function target (The name of the exported function to be invoked, leave blank if the source repository is a web server.) Service name: go-cache Region: us-west2 (tier2 is cheaper than tier1) Authentication: Public (unless you have something specific in mind) Billing: Request-based, Charged only when processing requests.

Yet there's a very strong case for running LLMs locally, much like every smart phone provides a powerful computer your pocket. As an example: helicopters can cover in 15 minutes what takes 2 hours by car, but the overhead and extra considerations (fuel, pilots, landings, weather sensitivity, etc.) makes them impractical for routine tasks like picking up kids from school. (Though those new autonomous drones can carry pretty heavy loads ;) Given English has ~170,000 words but the average working vocabulary is 30,000 words, and specific domains like \"email\" (Hello! Best Regards,) are even more narrow and formulaic... Do you need a model trained on the entirety of human knowledge with latency from expensive GPU clusters? Writing code is specialized due to its utilitarian nature; it has even more structure, repetition, and rules - especially if it's type-checked and compiled. How they work together In software, experienced engineers propose and design the architecture, whereas less experienced people do the (simpler parts) of implementation - specialization based on skill and scope. Frontier models can design and orchestrate, handle the unusual, while local models do specific, simple things well. Software engineers have learned to have a \"plan\" or \"write a spec\" phase specifically created with an advanced LLM, and that a local LLM can write out the code and tests for small well defined components. Inevitable and Resilient In 2020 an LLM was a research project and by 2024 it's running on your laptop (or smartphone!). Hardware gets better and costs go down which induces \"Jevons Paradox\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox ; as people adapt they'll use LLM inference non-stop. Moreover, users (and businesses!) dependent to always having AI will balk at \"cloud outages\" or \"AI outages\" - thus a real need and demand for local LLMs. (Have you ever seen people struggling to function without mobile phone signal/reception ;) And I didn't even bring up the privacy and security arguments...

Thus CSS was created, though it took awhile to become a fully adopted and usable standard (due to interests that would have preferred a private single browser definition and control). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS ascii diagram: ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ SOURCE CODE FILES (what you write) │ │ │ │ index.html style.css │ │ ┌───────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ │ │ │ <h1> │ │ h1 { │ │ │ │ <p> │ │ color: blue; │ │ │ │ <button> │ │ } │ │ │ └───────────┘ └──────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ │ │ ▼ │ │ ┌───────────┐ │ │ │ Browser │ │ │ └─────┬─────┘ │ │ ▼ │ │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ DOM (Document Object Model) - what the browser │ │ │ │ builds in memory, combining structure + style │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ document │ │ │ │ └── html │ │ │ │ └── body │ │ │ │ ├── h1 (color: blue) │ │ │ │ ├── p │ │ │ │ └── button │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ ▼ │ │ What you see on screen │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ As an application grows, or if you are not keen on customizing every detail of the style, it can become overwhelming managing a lot of CSS files (and which setting overrides which thing). Material UI for Styling Material UI (MUI) provides pre-built components that look decent out of the box and handle responsive design, accessibility, and theming. It is a framework that generates both HTML and CSS for you - so it is simple, but opinionated. To add Material UI dependencies to an existing React project: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/ example package.json { \"name\" : \"material-ui-example\" , \"private\" : true , \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"type\" : \"module\" , \"scripts\" : { \"dev\" : \"vite\" , \"build\" : \"vite build\" , \"preview\" : \"vite preview\" }, \"dependencies\" : { \"@emotion/react\" : \"&#94;11.14.0\" , \"@emotion/styled\" : \"&#94;11.14.1\" , \"@mui/material\" : \"&#94;7.3.6\" , \"react\" : \"&#94;18.2.0\" , \"react-dom\" : \"&#94;18.2.0\" , \"react-router-dom\" : \"&#94;6.20.0\" }, \"devDependencies\" : { \"@types/react\" : \"&#94;18.2.0\" , \"@types/react-dom\" : \"&#94;18.2.0\" , \"@vitejs/plugin-react\" : \"&#94;4.2.0\" , \"vite\" : \"&#94;7.1.3\" } } A simple React and MUI code example App.jsx import { useState } from 'react' ; import { Button , Box , Typography } from '@mui/material' ; const content = [ [ \"hello world\" , \"more content on line 2\" ], [ \"github.com/mui has more info\" ] ]; function App () { const [ activeContentIndex , setActiveContentIndex ] = useState ( 0 ); return ( < Box sx = {{ p : 2 }} > < Box sx = {{ mb : 2 }} > < Button onClick = {() => setActiveContentIndex ( 0 )} > View 1 < /Button> < Button onClick = {() => setActiveContentIndex ( 1 )} > View 2 < /Button> < /Box> < div > { content [ activeContentIndex ]. map (( line , i ) => ( < Typography key = { i } paragraph > { line } < /Typography> ))} < /div> < /Box> ); } export default App ; Box is a Material-UI generic wrapper: a <div> that accepts the sx property sx is a Material-UI shorthand for a property p = padding, all sides, 2 x 8px = 16px m = margin-bottom, 2 x 8px = 16px Button has Material Design ripple effect, hover states, and theming Typography applies Material Design font family, sizes, and spacing and renders as <p> by default There is no longer App.css and index.css since MUI is handling all the styling. Thus your React framework code is now React + Material-UI, effectively a \"Domain Specific Language\" that quickly builds and renders frontend apps. Google Single Sign On There are quite a few options for security, and identity (followed by authentication and authorization), and if you attempt to write it all yourself you can inadvertantly create a security issue. One of the most popular Identity Providers to leverage is Google (due to gmail and youtube and large consumer reach). For simple apps where your users will already have a Google Account, here is an easy way to have them verify their identity with Google and then share their email address with your application. This allows for a \"frontend only\" app to have personalization, and is an important pre-requisite when added to a backend. Create a Google OAuth Client For an existing (or new) Google Cloud Project , start the flow with the OAuth Consent Requests user consent so your app can access the user's data Create https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview/create fill out the questionnaire about the Application and intended use (starting with Internal or Test users is simplest) fill in contact email address, and \"terms and conditions\" \"OAuth configuration created\" Create OAuth client (button) Application type: web application Add http://localhost:5173 to Authorized JavaScript origins (for local dev) if you know it already you can add the domain where your production React App runs (i.e. https://yourusername.github.io/) Create (button) Copy the Client ID - this is what you put in your environment variables or code i.e. really-long-random-numbers-and-characters.apps.googleusercontent.com Note that this client ID is a public facing configuration value (ends up in JS code visible in the browser dev tools) Environment Variable Using an Environment variable allows setting a different value for Development, Staging, and Production. Create the file .env in your project root with the following in it: VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com (Also make sure you add .env to your .gitignore ;) Make sure you also set the value in your build process (or via integration with a hosting provider like AWS Amplify or Cloudflare ) that creates the final bundle Load the Google Identity Services Script index.html <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" /> < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> < title > My SSO App </ title > < script src = \"https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client\" async defer ></ script > </ head > < body > < noscript > You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. </ noscript > < div id = \"root\" ></ div > < script type = \"module\" src = \"/src/main.jsx\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Google Sign-In Component GoogleSignIn.jsx import { useEffect , useRef , useState } from \"react\" ; export default function GoogleSignIn ({ onAuth }) { const [ gsiReady , setGsiReady ] = useState ( false ); const [ authStatus , setAuthStatus ] = useState ( null ); const googleButtonRef = useRef ( null ); const renderedRef = useRef ( false ); useEffect (() => { const clientId = import . meta . env .

If you use \"OAuth authorization code flow\", you must configure redirect URIs and handle the code exchange on a backend. Importantly: if you have any backend/API you should send the Google ID token to the backend and have code to truly verify it (signature + issuer + audience + expiry).

Println ( \"done\" ) } func count () { fmt . Println ( \"sleep then count\" ) time . Sleep ( 2 ) for i := 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ { fmt . Printf ( \"%d\" , i ) } } func foo () { fmt . Println ( \"foo\" ) } https://go.dev/play/p/KX-bMG0KBBu This code example highlighted that when main exits all goroutines also exit, even if they have not completed. Golang WaitGroup In order to add control over the goroutines there are many tools, the simplest is WaitGroup. package main import ( \"fmt\" \"sync\" \"time\" ) func example ( s string ) { time . Sleep ( 1 * time . Second ) fmt . Println ( s ) } func exampleAsync ( s string , wg * sync . WaitGroup ) { defer wg . Done () time . Sleep ( 1 * time . Second ) fmt . Println ( s ) } func main () { fmt . Println ( time . Now ()) example ( \"hello\" ) example ( \"world\" ) fmt . Println ( time . Now ()) var wg sync . WaitGroup wg . Add ( 2 ) go func ( s string ) { example ( s ) wg . Done () }( \"foo\" ) go exampleAsync ( \"bar\" , & wg ) wg . Wait () fmt . Println ( time . Now ()) fmt . Println ( \"done\" ) } https://go.dev/play/p/YYJVC36uB5r The whole program executes in 3 seconds: even as sequentially things take 2 seconds, the next 2 sleep statements occur concurrently. A WaitGroup must in advance be passed a count that matches every execution of \"Done()\" (usually by goroutines). Even though the anonymous function that wraps \"example()\" and \"exampleAsync()\" both have a 1 second sleep statement, the output shows they run concurrently. The anonymous function in the middle shows how to pass a string parameter, and also that the waitgroup variable is available through \"closure\". https://go.dev/tour/moretypes/25 https://gobyexample.com/closures For readability, maintainability, and re-use most people write a separate function rather than using anonymous functions. Passing the waitgroup by reference is safe as it is designed for coordinating goroutines, and the \"defer\" keyword just ensures that just as the function exits that statement will immediately execute. package main import ( \"fmt\" \"sync\" ) func main () { var wg sync . WaitGroup wg . Add ( 2 ) go func ( s string ) { example ( s ) wg . Done () }( \"foo\" ) wg . Wait () fmt . Println ( \"done\" ) } This is a common gotcha where the program will deadlock as the WaitGroup forever expects one more \"Done()\" than the code provides.","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/golang-concurrency-part-1-waitgroup/"},{"title":"Compensation Planning is Sudoku with Feelings","text":"Compensation planning is like \"extra hard Sudoku\" except once you've figured it all out... you still have to convince each square that it's the right solution Always challenging, never a straightforward \"satisfying\" outcome. What is compensation planning and why do you care? Every organization has some fixed budget. Yes there's a little wiggle room, but there's also a breaking point. Compensation is \"buying time with salaries\": when you are in charge of an organization you owe it to them, to everyone, to spend responsibly. It is not sustainable to spend everything today and having nothing for tomorrow. Leadership is providing some measure of predictability. You must devote at least a couple of hours (or days) to planning and budgeting your largest expense of your most precious resource. So you have N people, and you have budget X. And if you mess it up really badly you'll either have 0 people or 0 dollars (actually you can go negative but that's very unpleasant). Fundamentals of compensation planning Classically you keep salaries (the majority of spending at most successful companies) separate from \"everything else\" (real estate, vendors, infrastructure). Start with last month's total payroll x 12. That's your baseline spend. Ask your HR or Board for clarity on any existing or historical policies on how this has been handled previously (or should be handled going forward). Usually you are not doing this in complete isolation What your organization needs Before you start planning, make sure you first learn what your organization needs for the coming year: Ask your manager Ask your CEO Ask your CFO Ask your Board There will be conflicting, even contradictory answers. That's okay =] Everyone's predicting the future, and that's hard. Ideally there will be a theme, and finding overlaps gives you a direction/pattern. Is this a growth year with hiring? Maybe it's a \"hold tight\" year with a slightly shrinking budget. Even in a shrinking budget there may be projects or opportunities the organization is willing to invest in. Understand what your company wants to pay for, and where your team members (skills, experience, etc.) may fit in that picture. Identify which key people (in priority order) would most impact the company if they left. Have you done succession planning? More importantly: which people have a track record of success and you believe represent the future of your organization? What your people need Gather your data about your people and their compensation history When were they hired? When were they promoted within your organization? When have they received raises? Has there been a trend to their compensation (plateau, spikes, exponentially up)? Gather your data (hopefully from your regular one-on-ones) about what your people most prioritize. People want different things (either stated or revealed preferences), so have private notes of their priority ranked list of these things... cold hard cash equity bigger bonus when things go well flexibility in working hours flexibility in location/remote more PTO more autonomy and/or responsibilities in their work Some Example Personas Alice was hired 4 years ago and prefers cash above all else. She has had regular raises every year at 3%. She's still at the low end of the salary band for her level - and you really want to retain her steady troubleshooting skills and institutional knowledge. Bob was hired 2 years ago and prefers equity and working remote. He's only had one raise during a promotion of 7%. His performance is a roller coaster, and even though he's recently had a promotion he said he thinks he's under-levelled. Charlie was hired 3 years ago and has never had a raise. Charlie likes PTO. Charlie's well liked by everyone. He's also at the top of his salary band and privately co-workers wonder if he's pulling his weight. Good Practices Having distinct levels with responsibilities in a career ladder is a data driven approach to evaluating performance and promotions. there are many career ladders published on GitHub - consider using even a most rudimentary version of just two categories: \"new grad\" and \"senior\" You should strive to be fair and objective. Not just because it's the right thing to do - but because that's a reproducible framework that creates predictable outcomes. Salary bands for a given level are a common practice and available through a variety of sources. (see Radford's data or Milkovich et al.'s \"Compensation\") If you don't have salary bands you may have trouble recognizing that someone is underpaid (or overpaid) compared to market benchmarks. Remove your emotions from the process. There is a place for emotions, but not in the current calculus of budgets and planning. The feelings come when you are delivering these decisions to real people. Framework = rules based, and these rules should be statistically relevant. Rules for one-offs will add a lot unnecessary complexity. Use a \"Parity\" principle: keeping people in the same levels or cohorts in a very close (or identical values) Build your framework Start with: What does the company need? (specific skills? leadership? an upcoming key project/feature?) What are the factors you care most about? (tenure? retention? innovation?) Create your custom spreadsheet with the header columns. First pass strategy: ignore the framework for a moment and just write down what feels right for each person. This gut-check baseline helps you see where your instincts diverge from your rules. put the basic info in - level, current salary, proposed raise have a running sum at the bottom to see what the total is then remodel and tweak variables Use a rating system (i.e. performance on a scale of 1 to 5) that maps to percentages: 1 : 0 % raise 2 : 1 % raise 3 : 3 % raise 4 : 5 % raise 5 : 7 % raise of course change those values to whatever you and your organization find best Raises should be meaningful to the individual for \"a very good performer\" Create distinct gaps between the \"low performers\" and \"high performers\" Bonuses are for specific effort in a given time period or year, Salary/Compensation is paying someone for ongoing and future responsibilities Review Now that you have your draft... Ask HR for data industry comparables (Radford data) (anonymized?) other departments/groups in your company Historical trends? Anomalies or unconscious bias? Ask for feedback from trusted places: review with frontline managers (they have to deliver/live with your decisions) \"what did I miss?\" \"what did you think about ratings/framework?\" Are you at risk of losing high performers? examine individual cases Managing Up You have done your research and created a draft: this output artifact is essential to get real feedback from the people who need to approve it. Share it in advance and schedule a meeting. Be open and curious as this is your opportunity to discover more. Getting alignment early makes it much easier to subsequently get approval. Nuances Do look for an opportunity to correct an unconscious/undesired trend - just because someone else made a mistake earlier doesn't let you off the hook When you have to fix things, small corrections (sometimes over multiple years) are preferred over one large change that looks like a \"shadow promotion\" Focus on professional performance, Avoid life/family decisions as input: you don't know every invidual person's situation. If you skew things and then later learn someone else had \"more need\" would that be fair? Would you need to ask/pry into every employee's personal and private situations? Raises as absolute numbers or percentages: most people can understand both so pick one and be consistent. If you use percentages, at larger salaries this can become surprisingly large absolute-number raises When someone is getting a raise or promotion, make sure the amount they're receiving \"makes a difference\". Giving someone a 1% raise sometimes feels like the worst of both worlds: you are using up budget and the person may get the sense \"we don't value you\". Either give a larger raise like 3% or explain \"HR/company default for middle performers is 1%\", here are the things you can do to be a high performer. International and Company Patterns If you have employees spread internationally it may be very difficult to compare without regard to the local economy. Many innovative organizations have attempted to have a \"single global salary\" and eventually capitulated to economic realities. Your organization may deliberately choose to not be competitive to the market. You will have to indicate that losing people will affect capacity/timelines, and extra costs for recruiting and hiring a replacement. Is there an implicit pattern sought or enforced by your company? The expectation over a large enough distribution of a bell curve or \"bottom 10% get 0?\" it's confronting these types of practices that remind you how important your role is in understanding what the organization says vs does - and how your team are impacted Adjusting to fit your budget When your compensation proposal doesn't fit your budget, you've got to tweak some things :| People who are at the top of a salary band are less likely to feel the a small absolute reduction. If you have excess (lucky you!), consider distributing that to the \"bottom\" earners first as that may have the most relative impact Use round numbers: we're human! - This also means, if you need to round down, do so on the higher end first What if I'm handed a finished compensation plan? Do your homework. If you spot a serious error you can raise it with your manager and potentially prevent an embarrassing or even consequential mistake. Showing interest and doing this exercise shows you are preparing to take on more responsibility. When is it done? Sleep on your decisions. Review them again with fresh eyes. These numbers can affect people's life decisions: a progression in their career, where they live, if they get a new car, where their kids go to school or university, etc. They deserve your best when you're making such critical decisions. If I got this raise from my manager how would I feel? If I was a manager who had to deliver this compensation change would I know what to say and how explain it? Can the organization deal with the consequences if someone is unhappy and leaves? Another round of (hopefully small) tweaks and reviews should go much faster. Reality bites: sometimes you do this perfectly and then the organization comes back and asks you to reduce your proposal by 10%. No one ever said the work was easy, but someone has to do it, and do it well. Delivering the changes Once it is all approved and you have printed compensation change (or promotion!) letters, practice sharing the news. Each person deserves an individual conversation, even if you feel like the change was routine or that it was \"a large raise and that should make them happy\". (Research confirms that pay systems affect different people in different ways \"Personnel Psychology\" from Fulmer et. al.) Do not start with assumptions, every person has unique circumstances and reacts differently Do give them the letter with the number and at least a minute to read and process Do listen and observe their reaction, and ask them if they have any questions or feedback Do not offer any promises to change things, but do take notes and look into concrete concerns sometimes people need a day or week to fully process, be open and prepared for them to bring those questions about a week later Part of the reason you put in all the effort to a framework and process is to be prepared to persuade each part of the \"Sudoku Puzzle\" why the solution you've chosen works. And sometimes, when you've done this work with care and delivered it with empathy, even if they're not happy with the result, they will understand that you worked hard on their behalf.","tags":"leadership","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/compensation-planning-is-sudoku-with-feelings/"},{"title":"The answer is not the solution","text":"Look at the number 5: it can have many of representations: IIIII , 10/2 , 05.00 , 5&#94;1 Those representations are not \"wrong\", they are all still \"5\". When people argue about a solution, they can both be \"right\", and yet there is a reason to pick one solution over another. If you are adding incrementally, 5 becoming 6 and then 7 is a complete rewrite, whereas IIIII I becomes IIIII II is much easier to append. (Though it also has a downside of readability at scale ;) If you are already starting a problem knowing \"10\", then \"10/2\" is a more natural fit. When you intend to progress to 05.13 and then 05.99 , clearly decimal has its place. One should be aware that assigning the number 5 to a group of stones has no impact on those stones. Our form does not change their content. So when you hear of a different solution, rather than assuming someone else is wrong, ask yourself: does this other representation have a different benefit? Furthermore, when you have cleverly come up with a solution \"5\", do not mistake that with necessarily changing the world.","tags":"puzzles","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/the-answer-is-not-the-solution/"},{"title":"Front Line Manager or Director - Managing People Managers","text":"Titles mean nothing People get hung up on titles and status: \"Manager\"... of what? Does this mean you get to tell people what to do? So a Director directs people? The job is always to solve (hard) problems and create value. The kernel of truth: Manager and Director are distinct in expected outcomes and focus areas. Director is not as simple as Manager++ or VPE-- A front-line manager's focus is the immediate results and to care about people who do the work. A director's focus is often upward and outward: outcomes that matter to the organization and business, teams and systems that accomplish those things. Managers are necessary overhead Why aren't top sports teams \"self-managed\"? These top athletes are the best at what they do, so why do they have a coach? People want consistently winning teams. If the CEO could just directly tell everyone \"Do X\" and it worked, they would. Likewise every Individual Contributor would prefer autonomy and to focus on their work rather than having to \"report to someone\" and \"performance evaluations\". A manager represents stability for an organization: a continuing business function that has clear ownership. A dependable and reliable part of the larger structure. A manager is not \"the next rung up the ladder\" for an IC but a completely different kind of work, requiring unique skills and responsibilities. It is a lateral move into a different discipline like Design or Science where prior skills and experience don't transfer automatically. Good managers are worth their weight in gold - or even their weight in bitcoin ;) Creating leverage is valuable What does leverage look like as a People Manager? An engineering IC creates a frequently used software library or widely adopted architectural pattern: \"leverage\" to multiply their impact on the organization (and beyond). A people manager can uniquely scale their effectiveness and influence by: hiring and retaining great people converting chaos into an efficient process building a great culture Every org has a lot of noise, someone needs to filter for signal and help provide emphasis. As a great manager - manage yourself As a Great People Manager, you first manage yourself =) Are you self aware of your emotional state and mindset - how are you showing up and connecting to others? Do you bring positive energy to your team and colleagues? Do you know what the highest priority most impactful things that you can do are? Effectively manage your own time and calendar? Have you spent time trying to understand how your manager and company's leadership team communicate? What is their mindset and favored mechanisms of communication? Professionalism: on time, prepared for meetings and conversations? Take notes and have action items? Own your action items and follow through? Do you communicate clearly in writing, verbally, and with images and diagrams? Do you understand your own strength and areas for improvement, what kind of personalities complement your working style? Are you deliberately investing in improving your skills and opportunities for more experience? What does a Manager even do? The job is often reminding people of things they already know ;) The Manager role is indirect and requires patience: long periods of boring (necessary) work punctuated by busy extremes (hiring, performance reviews, promotions, layoffs, receiving resignations) System/code deep dives are intellectually draining - but often emotionally \"neutral\". People are not logical software. A people manager's role is integrating humans into a system, and humans are emotionally taxing. And the job involves common sense: request PTO in advance (so people can cover the work), don't show up 20 minutes late for every meeting. A manager cares about Results and Retention A people manager has to \"show up\", especially in critical times, but overall it is a role requiring reliability. accountable for success and failure clarify priorities (because situational awareness and context!) and unblock aligning the right resources to problems ensure a good working environment, that people have tools, processes, etc to do their best work how people's work advances the organization, and also furthers careers Intensity in 1:1s, Presence for group meetings \"crowd control\" https://cate.blog/2015/12/23/the-hardest-shortest-lesson-becoming-a-manager/ https://www.manager-tools.com/2015/06/results-and-retention-part-1-hall-fame-guidance https://www.manager-tools.com/2015/06/results-and-retention-part-2-hall-fame-guidance Quality Control Increased responsibility means more accountability. Every time you hire or promote someone you are putting your credibility (as a decision maker) on the line. Having a background in a given domain makes it easier to identify when things are going wrong, or performance issues. (For instance, modifying code directly in live production systems is usually a bad idea). As an engineering manager, have you ever seen an engineer: write unit test coverage for logging but not tests if the feature actually works? merge code but always forget to deploy? have lots of opinions, arguments, and criticisms in meetings but never write code? A manager observes, actively listens: Is there a pattern? An unvoiced concern or problem? Then a manager shares with the right people a distilled summary of what's going on, and what change is needed. Trust and credibility is built by turning pieces of information into action and results. Mindset of a \"legacy manager\" How many people are in my organization, and how do I get more? Hard work is measured by who sits the longest at their desk Counting the output of widgets (instead of the outcomes) Uses biases (especially pre-conceived) and argumentativeness (or \"winning\") jumping to a conclusion about who is the decisionmaker; the blame game One on ones and alignment are overhead - they get paid, don't they? Compliments and praise are over-rated, it's their job! Why should I develop someone's career when they'll just use it to leave? (or \"that's HR's job\") I should send them my random thoughts at any time, day or night - it's their job to be available and figure it out Unnecessarily going fast and taking risks - activity theater (over) committing when there's any doubt of followthrough Stay in my lane, keep my head down, and mouth shut: enforce that for others too premature public announcements! spreading gossip, misinformation, or disinformation If reading these things makes you uncomfortable, consider reflecting on the ever evolving nature of the knowledge worker A Modern Manager of Knowledge Workers A modern manager understands the symbiotic nature of talent and an organization, genuinely finds alignment and valuable opportunities (including when someone's career leads them to another role - even outside of the company), and communicates clearly. Solving the problems of your \"1st Team\" Managing people and resources is leverage to solve business problems. Your peers - your first team - are telling you what they (and the business) need. If you only do what your manager tells you, just an extension of only your manager's asks... then you're not proactive, not aligned to the business priorities, and not a team player with others genuinely trying to solve company problems. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjE_mPoZPSg \"Team #1\" by Patrick Lencioni A helpful checklist: do your direct reports know what your quarterly or monthly goal is? How they can contribute to success? do you communicate clearly what you expect? when did you last give each direct report a compliment in private? in public? when have you invested in your direct reports: coached them through something? they learned something new? received a raise or a promotion? expansive view of everything they do to make their organization and group successful Litmus test questions about trust: do your direct reports feel safe enough and are you curious enough, to learn the names of their loved ones, including pets? do your direct reports feel safe enough to bring you problems and give you feedback? Recognize people for who they want to be, build trust every day Prioritizing career development over business needs If you are prioritizing your own career development or more charitably your direct report's career progressions at the expense of the business outcomes, then you are clearly in a \"local maxima\". Aligning what your direct reports or you need to develop along with business priorities is good management. Don't mistake balance for equality... Thought experiment: if every manager focused primarily on their direct reports' career development - giving them opportunities to fail and learn and explore - while neglecting what the business needs... and the business fails. Then nobody has a career to develop! Challenging Moments and Hard Decisions If the business is failing then saving the business - which is everybody's job, may be more important than whether your direct report gets a promotion or retained. Avoiding needless attrition is common sense, but in a crisis, priorities compress and trade-offs get explicit. Is a Director just Manager++ or VPE--? Director as Manager++: you're a \"super manager\" who happens to have managers reporting to you. This works when the business is stable and the primary value is execution consistency. It fails spectacularly when the organization needs strategic pivots or cross-functional coordination. Director as VPE--: treated as a junior executive, expected to think about business problems, tradeoffs, and org design. This works when the company is scaling or transforming. It fails when you neglect the humans in your organization because you're too busy in leadership meetings. As a director, the extra layer of indirection between \"leadership\" and \"front line managers\" changes everything. Director reality: all the problems are now your problems. Bubbling up from the front lines, and trickling (or crashing ;) down from above. Understand the value stream from initial ideas and stakeholders through design and requirements build development, testing deployment, and monitoring. Have metrics (or a dashboard) doesn't have to be thorough, just enough to give you a warning signal to investigate. Managing a Manager Everybody has a first time they became a manager (and the role is already hard!), a great leader helps people nagivate the change. Hopefully you've learned to become a great people manager before becoming a \"manager of managers\" - it's never too late! And just like a Manager is not effective trying to do every one of their direct report's jobs, someone Managing a Manager has to focus on teaching about people management (not taking over or micro-managing). As a concrete example, when hearing one of my managers bring up not feeling connected to a new direct report, we discussed that there actually many ways to have a one-on-one: the direct report has their own agenda John offers a \"choose your own adventure\" of topics (e.g. how can I help unblock something? larger context in the org or business? career conversation?) the direct report drives with just a stream of consciousness - your job is to actively listen and spot trends and anomalies the manager drives (when very comfortable with their manager, likes someone else exposing them to new topics/ideas) Seek first to understand Be curious about their perspective: value and opportunities they see, challenges they experience, approaches they've tried help them construct their own individualized plan for success For a first time front-line manager the sub-graph of the organization is small: often focused \"downward\" to just their direct reports. Teach and encourage (even to the point of discomfort) people managers to navigate peer relationships and \"managing up\": invest time and build relationships before you need them understand other disciplines and roles, what do they need to succeed? ensure you listen first, ask and follow through on supporting them An existential lesson is that Managers create a predictable sub-system. Even Managers with innate people relationship talent have to learn to become systematic, have frameworks, and regular feedback (even difficult conversations) to keep things on track. What Directors Must Learn (That Managers Can Ignore) A manager asks \"What should my team work on?\" A director asks \"What can only I do, what should I delegate, and what can wait?\" Be explicit in what level of delegation you are actually expecting: https://www.jillwetzler.com/resources/delegation Know what the org/business needs from your domain. A manager can get away with \"my team ships good code.\" A director cannot stop there. You need to understand revenue, runway, competitive positioning, and which parts of your technical portfolio directly impact those things. Proactively share your group's status and health. Your manager (VP, CTO, whoever) has limited attention. They need a signal, not a firehose of details. Learn to communicate \"we're on track\" or \"we're at risk because X\" in 30 seconds or less. Improve your group's productivity. Not activity, Outcomes! This requires understanding what outcomes matter (see above) and then relentlessly removing obstacles to those outcomes. Efficiency and cost. At the manager level, headcount is something that happens to you. At the director level, you're accountable for spend. Every engineer-month is real money invested, are you getting a return? Engineering Leadership is Systems Thinking About People Here's a mental model to consider: A great senior engineer knows which service to modify, which file to open, which lines of code to change to have the most impact on the system. A director of engineering knows which people to talk to, what to say to them, and how to sequence those conversations to have the most impact on the organization. What is the goal of the system, the weaknesses and greatest opportunities? growth and transformation succession planning personality alchemy, blending skills and experiences technological investment: balancing innovation and legacy Directors think in \"teams\", not \"individuals\"... A manager thinks about \"Retention and Results\", a Director has to systemize and scale: reproducible successes manage risk determinism with people Find the right people who understand the high leverage techniques (technology or organizational), find/create the right org structure to put those people in the places where they can do impactful work with the sense of ownership and accountability. Get the right people on the bus, in the right seats https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html Culture: The Thing Directors Actually Own As a manager you participate in culture, yet at the director level, you shape it. Outputs vs Outcomes: are you a metrics and process driven organization, or results and outcome driven? Engineering best practices: are they documented? Enforced? Evolving? Learning tools: books, video courses, internal wikis. Do people have access and do they know they exist? Lunch and learns, hackathons, team and company demos: these don't happen by accident, make space for them and protect that space when delivery pressure mounts. Fun events: connecting people matters. Remote-first makes this harder and no longer optional. Interviewer training: being an interviewer is a completely different skill. Do your people know how to do it? Are they calibrated? Ownership: testing, \"you build it you run it,\" production responsibility. Is this just a slogan or a regular practice? Blameless retros and continuous learning: do people feel safe raising concerns? Do incidents lead to learning or blame? Psychological safety: \"see it, say it.\" If people can't raise problems, the problems don't go away - they just become surprises. Embracing difficult conversations and feedback, navigating how to have them even when it's uncomfortable but you need to have a conversation https://rework.withgoogle.com/intl/en/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness The spotlight and microphone: what is your organization celebrating? What is getting rewarded as \"high performance\" and ensuring the optics match reality - help teams see and participate in the wins Is something missing? Of course =) There's no complete guide because it has to be guided by what your organization needs - even as your organization changes. When considering becoming a people manager or a Director, the promotion is not simply \"more work\", these are truly different challenges and roles that deserve careful and open minded learning. Appendix of Checklists Manager Activities Ensuring the following for their team members: roadmaps, sprints tracking work and bugs and launch checklists on-call, runbooks, postmortems accountability on projects and deliverables team and project retrospectives how to identify when team has toil, waste?

All of it matters. The Middle Manager Playbook Here's what actually happens when you're the quintessential middle manager: Receive a Vision or Strategy from above (leadership, maybe a passthrough from the board) Ask questions to gain understanding: context, scope, expectations, timelines, risk, feasibility Write it up in your own words (refer back to the authoritative source doc) Understand dependencies and coordination - go from ideas to a plan Get feedback from your \"right hand person\" and trusted peers - this is where being cross-functional is a necessity If necessary, convey that feedback all the way back up to the top Write up comms (explain the Why!) Ensure there are milestones, clarity on who does what (in what order), who the leads/champions are, where/how to ask questions and raise issues Roll it out to your org, capture questions and feedback Have scheduled check-ins, keep the project on track, and check in \"upward\" to understand changes in priority, urgency, or scope It looks obvious written down but it is not obvious when you're in the middle of three conflicting priorities with incomplete information from above and limited capacity below.","tags":"leadership","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/front-line-manager-or-director-managing-people-managers/"},{"title":"CircleCI for a Pelican static Github site","text":"When I realized my previous CI/CD vendor had finally broken something (after 7 years travis.org incompatibly became travis.com) I decided out with the old and in with the new.

(all lowercase ;) I wanted to document how I successfully migrated some of my other hobby projects to CircleCI so future me (and anyone else) can more easily replicate the steps because CircleCI has a free tier for CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment). I make no guarantee that CircleCI will continue to be free in the future (but if stops being free I will likely write another blog post about how to use a different service ;) Why I chose CircleCI Free (even more free for open source projects) Straightforward documentation with good examples Integrated with github (and bitbucket) It just works (relatively quick execution and feedback loop) CircleCI Build Terminology A Project maps to a code repository You configure each Project to do certain things when a new commit occurs. A pipeline are all the things that happen when your Project is triggered (i.e. new code or manual re-run). A workflow is the definition (and execution) of all the jobs in a pipeline; note that jobs can run in parallel. A job is a collection of steps that are going to happen (i.e. checkout code and run a command) A job must have an execution environment (i.e. a docker container) A step is doing a single thing (i.e. checkout code) https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/concepts/?section=getting-started Getting Started by Authorizing CircleCI Start with the source code: setup a repository (i.e. in github) , e.g. https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/stringsmoar Go to CircleCI's login page and choose to \"Sign Up\" https://circleci.com/signup/ For the paranoid like me you can choose to only share your public github repos Once you use the oauth-like permissions screen that provides your username and password to Github so it can authorize CircleCI to access all of your bits. This is the one time you \"authorize all the access\", everything afterwards are config files that are fine to be in public code repos. In Github you can review what applications have access to your github account's source code with https://github.com/settings/applications \"Authorized Oauth Apps\" In CircleCI you can now see what projects you can setup builds, apparently segregated by \"organization\" https://app.circleci.com/projects/ Setup a Project Not too surprisingly the UI then displays a list of all of the repos https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/github/johnpfeiffer/ \"Set Up Project\" makes sense but for some odd reason the terminology is to \"follow a project\" when something has been configured by someone else in your organization The UI will attempt to helpfully suggest a configuration yaml based on auto-detecting the repository's programming language. For Golang CircleCI presumes you are using go mod so I guess I ought to upgrade my old code repos now that there's an official standard If you choose the pre-generated configuration file CircleCI will attempt to commit and push that new .circleci/config.yml into your repo and then start a Build. Instead of the auto-generated configuration you can select Use Existing Config (in which case you should have already uploaded into github remote your preferred CircleCI reference)... your-repo/.circleci/config.yml version : 2.1 # https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference jobs : resource_class : small build : working_directory : ~/repo # the circleCI default for where code is checked out to in the docker build container docker : - image : cimg/go:1.21.4 steps : - checkout - run : name : Run unit tests command : | go test -v ./... Double checking your Golang Version The wonderful thing about Docker is the extra transparency. In this case we might want to double check the version of Golang that is being used by the build agent. You can download and execute the same environment locally: docker run --rm -it circleci/golang:1.21.4 go version go version go1.21.4 linux/amd64 https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/golang/ Cannot find main module is a common error for older golang code repos go: cannot find main module This means you have created a golang repo awhile back (Golang 1.15 and older) but are now using a newer/later Golang binary... To resolve the issue run this golang command in the top directory of your source code: go mod init This will create a go.mod file in your repository that allows dependencies to be properly resolved (and go test which implicitly uses \"go mod\" to execute successfully) Once that go.mod is committed and sent up to the Main branch in your github repo then CircleCI build will detect it and your \"go test\" step during the build/test steps will stop failing https://golang.org/ref/mod#mod-commands Tweaks to your CircleCI Config After you have successfully run a build then the UI will show you: how long the build took what git sha commit kicked off the build commit message all the steps executed and output, etc. https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/johnpfeiffer/stringsmoar/7/workflows/39b3f880-2473-49d7-804d-d1364f08853e/jobs/9 Rerun a build in CircleCI Sometimes it can take a bit to get used to the CircleCI UI, to drill down to a specific build your \"breadcrumbs\" will look like: All Pipelines > your-projectname > branch (main) > workflow > build (4) In that detailed output UI, to Rerun a build, choose the \"Rerun\" button from the beginning (or from a failed step) Flaky tests aka intermittent failures is not resolved by re-running your build/tests all the time ;p Specific Project Settings in CircleCI Deploy Keys (specific to a repo) are a better security practice - read below on how to configure your poject to use them =) In the CircleCI UI, for a given Project, the three little dots will allow you to choose how to configure the project https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/github/johnpfeiffer/stringsmoar The one annoying thing is that if you remove your 3rd party access creds in GitHub it's a pain to reconnect CircleCI In the CircleCI configuration for a Project you should see a listing of SSH keys you have to remove (delete) the old \"deployment key\" there (which means CircleCI can no longer access github) then choose to re-add a deployment key (if you are signed into CircleCI with GitHub this will automatically generate it) Or unfollow the project, and then re-follow the project (which will then have CircleCI use your initial OAuth authorization to generate a new SSH deployment key in GitHub). Afterward you should see a new SSH key that CircleCI created in Github for this Project (the UI's both show the sha of the key but one is sha256 and the other is not) https://circleci.com/docs/github-integration/#deploy-keys-and-user-keys https://discuss.circleci.com/t/solved-permission-denied-publickey/19562 (someone else had the same problem and documented their solution) https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/stringsmoar/settings/keys Picking the size of your build executor By default CircleCI will choose executor size of \"medium\", if you want to save (free) credits then for smaller projects use \"small\" (or conversely if you need more cpu/ram choose a larger size) jobs : build : resource_class : small docker : - image : circleci/golang:1.16 Good news: builds usually trigger almost instantly so all the little config tweaks have a super fast feedback loop https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#available-docker-resource-classes https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/?section=getting-started Outputting Test Coverage and Artifacts CircleCI has an extra space in the UI to display specific test output or artifacts which makes it easy to see the most common pain points rather than digging through all of the build stages output. your-repo/.circleci/config.yml version : 2.1 # https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference jobs : resource_class : small build : working_directory : ~/repo # this is a circleCI default for where code is checked out to in the docker build container docker : - image : circleci/golang:1.16 # https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/golang/ , https://hub.docker.com/_/golang?tab=description environment : TEST_RESULTS : /tmp/test-results steps : - checkout - run : name : Run unit tests command : | go test -v ./... - run : name : Run code coverage command : | mkdir -p $TEST_RESULTS go test -coverprofile=c.out go tool cover -html=c.out -o coverage.html mv coverage.html $TEST_RESULTS go test -v ./... | go tool test2json > $TEST_RESULTS/test2json-output.json gotestsum --junitfile $TEST_RESULTS/gotestsum-report.xml - store_artifacts : # Upload files like code coverage html for later viewing https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/ path : /tmp/test-results destination : raw-test-output - store_test_results : # Upload test results for display https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/ path : /tmp/test-results Artifacts will be deleted after 30 days but would be output like this: https://12-123862890-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/raw-test-output/coverage.html#file0 The golang coverage.html as an artifact can be opened by your web browser and highlight in color specifically which code paths are covered by unit tests https://blog.golang.org/cover https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/ https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-go/ https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/golang-testing-benchmark-profiling-subtests-fuzz-testing/ the CircleCI golang docker container has the opensource helper \"gotestsum\" to generate junit style XML output from tests JUnit XML or Cucumber JSON test metadata files From here on out you should hopefully have only Green Builds!

Eventually it will create good cashflow (i.e. more money in your bank account each month). While I understand that some may find the concept of an \"unowned\" virtual currency appealing, creating bitcoin (aka \"mining\") in and of itself is not differentiated and does not create value. Buy (or rent) a server, run software with an algorithm, hope that your 1s and 0s are special enough to be \"worth something\" Note that the control of the \"coins or transactions accepted\" is defined by an external entity, so anyone can use the protocol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto Coinbase ( https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0776164D:US ) has a business model of creating a platform for speculators to gamble (on many crypto-currencies), but just like selling shovels during a gold rush, they are not in the virtual hills digging, instead they are comfortably collecting a huge pile of gold dust. With Bitcoin, there is no \"moat\" ( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp ); no way to grow your business other than increasing efficiency and reducing costs. It is not inherently more valuable to have more virtual 1s and 0s when there are an infinite number of possible random numbers, nor is it particularly valuable to write your own IOUs that are guaranteed by random other people writing IOUs. You cannot add so much efficiency to a Cost Center that it suddenly becomes a business model of its own. Creating Value Growing food is a way of creating value: people need food and someone creates it. Do people need cryptocurrency? Creating things that people want can be valuable (see Art). So Bitcoin is valuable as a way to digitally exchange value, and because other people think it might be more valuable later. A good business model should create more value, ideally in a novel and innovative way. Intrinsically then Bitcoin and mining Bitcoin are not creating value but \"enabling value\". The more you create Bitcoin the more you are helping someone else capture value ;) Without bitcoin how would crime in the digital world have been able to innovate? So maybe create Bitcoin as a good \"loss leader\" or a \"cost center\"? Cost Center and Profit Center Like many ideas, it is not the thing, it is just a way to think about things The \"Profit Center\" concept was coined by Peter Drucker in 1945 and it refers to thinking about the role a department or group (or project) plays in a company. One part of the company is making something of value, the core of the business that you are selling. As an example, \"creating and selling food\" is the profit center of some example business. So the management of the people who are \"creating and selling food\" is a Cost Center. (Yup, your manager is costing the business money!). Transporting the food is another cost center; a constant question is then \"How to get transportation costs down to zero?\" One might even posit that having people create and sell food is a cost center: why not robots? (of course then whomever maintains the robots is the cost center) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_center https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_centre_(business) Since Profit Centers are what everyone seeks, they are harder to find. They depend on Customers, on satisfying demand, on product market fit, etc... including many things that may be beyond your control. Cost Centers tend to provide the illusion of control (things you are paying for) and so are eminently more enjoyable to tweak and revise, presumably with less risk. You cannot save your way into riches If you save $1 a day from some habit or vice, you will have saved $7,300 in 20 years. Despite the sage advice to save money, one should be aware that compound interest is not magic. If you start with $10,000 and compound annually at 10% interest for 20 years you will have $67,275. To further debunk: starting with $10k is not entirely trivial, and I suspect nobody will be famous for having $67k 20 years from now. In fact, with inflation, I suspect very many people will have at least $67k which is a far cry from $1000k (aka $1m), and even a millionaire isn't as glamarous a title as it used to be. https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator Therefore to be rich and profitable you must make money. (Perhaps an unsurprising conclusion but for the penny pinchers) So a Cost Center improvement of 100%, on a company with $0 revenue, only reduces how fast your plane plummets to the earth. When to invest in a Cost Center There is an opportunity cost to being alive Time is not infinite. If you are focusing on your cost center you may be neglecting your profit center, yet there are definitely moments when the investment is worth it. When the Cost Center deficiencies become a distraction: if your business does not have electricity or your employees are lost in confusion and chaos then it seems much more challenging to expect your Profit Center to succeed. When the Cost Center is a strategic differentiator: it helps create the moat that others cannot cross. As an example: Amazon began offering free shipping (and escalating into 2-day, then 1-day, then hours etc.), which certainly costs a lot to do. Yet it reduced friction to purchasing (and enabled the very profitable Amazon Prime subscription service) which increased sales, strategically raising the bar for competitors to \"have a digital platform for buying things\". https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/3/18511544/amazon-prime-oral-history-jeff-bezos-one-day-shipping When the Cost Center will become your Profit Center, see Slack's business pivot away from creating an online game (presumably for profit) into collaborative realtime messaging (an internal tool that cost them money to build and operate). https://mastersofscale.com/stewart-butterfield-the-big-pivot/ When you need to explain to an Investor (present or future) that you are not wasteful, i.e. efficiency as a proxy for smarts/effectiveness. When you have revenue but your cost center is creating a risk to your cashflow, e.g. you are spending so much it seems unlikely you will be able to last long enough for your profit center to profit. TODO: add more good reasons, but do it later to avoid over-investing in a cost center ;p Bad Cashflow versus Bad Business A bad business model will lose money until it is all gone. Interestingly it is possible to have a good business model and still go out of business. Bad cashflow can kill a good business: you owe more money in a given month than you can pay your creditors and they want their payment now. Over a longer time horizon a good business model would have made everybody more money. Infinite time horizons are often similar to ponzi schemes where someone has to keep being the \"new sucker born every minute\". Thus the stereotype of a business person being conservative and frugal; they're controlling their cashflow, earning through profit over time. Contrast with a stereotypical \"great entrepeneur\" who takes risks and creates profit. Both approaches have the potential for being a bad business. How can you discern when \"losing money is fine\"? There's the usual routine of examining timelines (months and up to a few years - further than that and your crystal ball is the \"Profit Center\"), then considering risks, growth projections, competition, etc. One simple technical approach is to see how much improvement can occur to the Cost Center and the impact on the Profit Center. If you can invest and immediately improve your cashflow then you have a straightforward plan for improvement. As mentioned earlier, a bad business model does not have a Profit Center. Having no positive cashflow may be something that can be fixed. Should you work in a Cost Center? Sensibly a business needs to create revenue and reduce costs, so someone needs to work in the \"Cost Center\". If you are irresponsible and careless it seems unlikely you will be successful in a Cost Center. You may genuinely enjoy innovating on efficiency; the larger the scale or harder the problem then potentially the greater the impact. The company may have a cashflow issue and working in the Cost Center may save the company. It may be that the opportunity to join a growing/successful company is in the Cost Center; don't look a gift horse in the mouth. (A rising tide lifts all ships). Sometimes working in a Cost Center is a way to learn the foundations of a business - where are all the dependencies that created the situation for profit? In the \"DevOps\" (and TDD) culture there's a deliberate attempt to remove the artificial silos that would have created a \"cost center\" (like QA or Operations) in the first place by distributing the work (and automating the toil); everybody should work in a Cost center!","tags":"it","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/bitcoin-is-a-bad-business-model-and-when-to-invest-in-your-cost-center/"},{"title":"Sorting in Golang","text":"We maybe take for granted that humans sort things: having a list of favorites e.g. \"top ten songs\". Computers (and software) are exceptional for sorting since it is both boring and requires precision; especially for large data sets that are beyond the human brain. Sorting things (not just numbers!) is foundational in Computer Science, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm Sorting is often considered a \"free first step\" (since sorting is \"Big O n logn\") for many problems that already would take a least \"n logn\" to solve. Golang has made Sorting really easy and efficient. Both in terms of compute and memory Verbose implementation of Sorting with Go Primitives like a Map First, if you want to just stick with primitives, you can sort a particular item like this... package main import ( \"fmt\" \"sort\" ) // Person is defined by name and age type Person struct { Name string Age int } func main () { People := [] Person { { Name : \"Charles\" , Age : 25 }, { Name : \"Alice\" , Age : 25 }, { Name : \"Bob\" , Age : 24 }, } fmt . Printf ( \"Original Listing: %v \\n\" , People ) // Example of manually sorting using extra primitive data structures AgeToPeople := make ( map [ int ][] Person ) for _ , p := range People { // handle the edge case of not yet having a list entry in the map _ , ok := AgeToPeople [ p . Age ] if ! ok { AgeToPeople [ p . Age ] = [] Person { p } } else { temp := AgeToPeople [ p . Age ] AgeToPeople [ p . Age ] = append ( temp , p ) // this maintains the pre-existing order on duplicates } } // Sort by a property and then dereference the lookup map // get the unique list of ages (each map key is unique) var Ages [] int for age := range AgeToPeople { Ages = append ( Ages , age ) } sort . Ints ( Ages ) var PeopleSortedByAge [] Person for _ , age := range Ages { temp := AgeToPeople [ age ] for _ , p := range temp { PeopleSortedByAge = append ( PeopleSortedByAge , p ) } } fmt . Printf ( \"Sorted by age Listing: %v \\n\" , PeopleSortedByAge ) // Optionally create a subset of the \"lowest N members\" // this could be more efficient if it was applied during the PeopleSortedByAge loop PeopleSortedByAgeSubset := PeopleSortedByAge [: 2 ] fmt . Printf ( \"Stable Subset of Sorted by age: %v \\n\" , PeopleSortedByAgeSubset ) This code is verbose but does provide visibility and control: Not modifying the original slice, the exact property used for sorting, explicit handling of duplicates aka the \"stable sort\" property https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability ok, I am \"hand-waving\" when we use the built in sorting of Integers but I'm not looking to re-invent the wheel... To execute (or modify) the code yourself https://play.golang.org/p/A9IYxubb8yK Very easy and fast way to Sort in Go package main import ( \"fmt\" \"sort\" ) // Person is defined by name and age type Person struct { Name string Age int } func main () { People := [] Person { { Name : \"Charles\" , Age : 25 }, { Name : \"Alice\" , Age : 25 }, { Name : \"Bob\" , Age : 24 }, } fmt . Printf ( \"Original Listing: %v \\n\" , People ) sort . SliceStable ( People , func ( i , j int ) bool { return People [ i ]. Age < People [ j ]. Age }) fmt . Printf ( \"Original Sorted using BuiltIn SliceStable: %v \\n\" , People ) The anonymous function is passed in as a parameter to define how to compare elements in the slice and be aware that the Sort function modifies the original slice This sorting capability comes built in with the Go Standard Library https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#SliceStable Why sorting with Go is efficient Leveraging a well established implementation of sort saves a lot of developer time (and provides some guarantee of correctness). As a compiled language Go is performant in terms of compute (which often translates to reasonably fast wall clock time too). The use of Slices means under the hood there can be pointers and references rather than full copies which reduces memory consumption. https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro https://blog.golang.org/slices https://golang.org/src/sort/sort.go (quicksort but it could be any highly performant sort) Sorting objects in Go with Customization It is very powerful is to leverage Golang's interface capabilities and the Sort package. Since Go uses composition instead of inheritance any arbitrary data structure can support Sorting. https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_15. https://golang.org/pkg/sort/ Thus with a struct definition, then writing a few method definitions, one can sort a collection of objects. package main import ( \"fmt\" \"sort\" ) // Person is defined by name and age type Person struct { Name string Age int } func main () { People := [] Person { { Name : \"Charles\" , Age : 25 }, { Name : \"Alice\" , Age : 25 }, { Name : \"Bob\" , Age : 24 }, } fmt . Printf ( \"Original Listing: %v \\n\" , People ) sort . Sort ( ByAge ( People )) fmt .

To execute (or modify) the code yourself use https://play.golang.org/p/A9IYxubb8yK If I ever put more time into various ideas or helper functions it will end up here https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/go-sort-example Sorting in Reverse There is a helper function that just reverses the sorting order, so once you can Sort (because you fulfill the Interface), then you can \"reverse sort\" =) alternatively you could use a for loop and iterate over a sorted slice, starting from index length-1 down to 0 package main import ( \"fmt\" \"sort\" ) func main () { a := [] int { 4 , 2 , 1 , 3 } // convert a to an IntSlice so it can be Reverse Sorted sort . Sort ( sort . Reverse ( sort . IntSlice ( a ))) fmt .

Strings ( sortedKeys ) for _ , key := range sortedKeys { fmt . Printf ( \"%s %s \" , key , m [ key ]) } Sorting a map by Values Sorting a map by values is a little harder which is likely why a cursory internet search brings up far fewer code snippet examples ;) // SortByValue returns the Keys in the sorted order of the Values (does not guarantee Stability) func SortByValue ( m map [ string ] string ) ( sortedKeys [] string ) { // create a reverse lookup mapping that can handle collisions // (duplicates) when the same value has multiple occurrences ValueToKey := make ( map [ string ][] string ) for k , v := range m { _ , ok := ValueToKey [ v ] if ! ok { ValueToKey [ v ] = [] string { k } } else { temp := ValueToKey [ v ] ValueToKey [ v ] = append ( temp , k ) } } // sort the Values var uniqueValues [] string for v := range ValueToKey { uniqueValues = append ( uniqueValues , v ) } sort . Strings ( uniqueValues ) // get the corresponding Keys for _ , v := range uniqueValues { keys := ValueToKey [ v ] sortedKeys = append ( sortedKeys , keys ... ) } return } The gotcha is that different Keys could have the same Value Full source code examples: https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/go-sort-example","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/sorting-in-golang/"},{"title":"Using AWS CDK to configure deploy a Golang Lambda with APIGateway","text":"Infrastructure as Code helps guarantee the elusive determinism in infrastructure that we all seek in building applications and services. Often you can defer that complexity by using Heroku, Google App Engine, or other PaaS providers. But when you need to build something really complex (or with specific controls required including managing costs) then using IaaC to tame AWS Serverless reduces some of that pain. AWS have created their own specific product (domain specific language) \"CDK\" which competes with the venerable Terraform and nicely focused Serverless. All of these products use the json syntax of CloudFormation which is the foundational AWS syntax for describing resources It is straightforward to iteratively setup and use AWS CDK (with the native Typescript syntax). CDK vocabulary It all begins with stacks . From an object oriented perspective, a stack is a definition of components that can be instantiated. An \"app\" is a collection of related stacks. Let's say you wanted your persistence (DynamoDB) in one stack, and your more execution oriented components (APIGateway and Lambda) in another stack, and your App might have environment specific parameters it needs to define and pass through to each stack. This ability to use templates and customize how you structure things, reference other CDK files, etc. makes CDK very modular and re-usable (and yes Typescript is a programming language so you can have linters and tests). https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/stacks.html https://intro-to-cdk.workshop.aws/what-is-cdk.html Install the AWS CDK Tool Have to use npm to install the cdk tool... npm install -g aws-cdk https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html Setup the project directories mkdir cdk-example cd cdk-example Create a subdirectory to compartmentalize all the infrastructure code (from the rest of the application, i.e. don't mix the business logic with the infrastructure plumbing) mkdir infra cd infra cdk init app --language typescript creates the default files in this directory for an empty CDK app cdk ls InfraStack Names are hard but whatever you pick, like \"Infra\" , will then show up in the AWS resources everywhere related to this project Install the dependencies for AWS resources that CDK will manage Option 1: manually install dependencies (it will automatically insert this into package.json) npm install @aws-cdk/aws-s3 @aws-cdk/aws-lambda Option 2: write the lines into packages.json and run at the command line in the infra directory: npm install Writing files first (and ensuring they are in version control) is a more IaaC pattern \"dependencies\" : { \"@aws-cdk/aws-s3\" : \"*\" , \"@aws-cdk/core\" : \"*\" , \"source-map-support\" : \"&#94;0.5.16\" } Write the actual Infrastructure Code The initial application template creates an empty \"class\" that represents the \"stack\", we customize and replace that code with the following... lib/infra-stack.ts has only 2 changes to the default file, the import of S3 and the new Bucket resource \"MyExampleBucket\" import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core' ; import * as s3 from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3' ; export class InfraStack extends cdk . Stack { constructor ( scope : cdk.Construct , id : string , props? : cdk.StackProps ) { super ( scope , id , props ); new s3 . Bucket ( this , 'MyExampleBucket' , { versioned : true }); } } The import renames are important to be consistent in subsequent code, so if something is \"cdk\" then it is cdk.Construct More complex applications will use a \"main entry point\" that can refer to specific files for various stacks. - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/serverless_example.html Output CloudFormation from a CDK Typescript file cdk synth this command will output to the display the CloudFormation that will be sent/used by AWS Resources : MyExampleBucket8D68EFCA : Type : AWS::S3::Bucket Properties : VersioningConfiguration : Status : Enabled UpdateReplacePolicy : Retain DeletionPolicy : Retain Metadata : aws:cdk:path : InfraStack/MyExampleBucket/Resource CDKMetadata : Type : AWS::CDK::Metadata Properties : To preview what will occur between changes to the .ts file... cdk diff Deploy resources that CDK has defined cdk deploy warning, really making a change in AWS (based on your creds) InfraStack InfraStack: deploying...

Many tutorials for lambdas (even for CDK) use javascript or python since those dynamic languages can just be put in \"one more file\" without a build step. A tiny Go Web Request Handler Put a simple placeholder Golang Lambda in place using the Gin web framework for convenience mkdir cdk-example/examplefunction/ ; cd cdk-example/examplefunction/ vim main.go package main import ( \"context\" \"log\" \"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events\" \"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda\" \"github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-go-api-proxy/gin\" \"github.com/gin-gonic/gin\" ) var ginLambda * ginadapter .

Imagine writing code for a lambda that reads and writes from S3, but without any AWS. The AWS tool SAM does have a local mode but does not cover S3 nor Dynamo, etc. A great tool to fill this need is Localstack. Since its interfaces are compatible with AWS it is an excellent proxy. Mirroring environments of Development, Staging, and Production, along with Integration or Acceptance tests, are best practices that allow you to write code with confidence and catch issues much earlier (and therefore more cheaply) than \"Using your Users as QA in Production\" Prerequisites Background: my previous article about writing a lambda with Golang and deploying it to AWS. https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/go-faas-with-aws-lambda/ Install and configure the AWS CLI In order to interact with Localstack we will use the AWS CLI, welcome to the beauty of Interfaces (API driven development ;) sudo apt install awscli or for all the alternate installation options https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ Setup fake credentials... this will overwrite any existing ~/.aws/ config or credentials echo -e \"[default]\\n\\ region=us-east-1\\n\\ output=json\" > ~/.aws/config echo -e \"[default]\\n\\ aws_access_key_id=AKIAFAKE\\n\\ aws_secret_access_key=FAKE\" > ~/.aws/credentials https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html Simplest Localstack Lambda Configuration version : \"3\" services : localstack : image : \"localstack/localstack\" ports : - \"4574:4574\" # lambda environment : - SERVICES=lambda - LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker - DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock - DEBUG=1 volumes : - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" sudo docker-compose up Creating task_localstack_1 ... done Attaching to task_localstack_1 localstack_1 | Waiting for all LocalStack services to be ready localstack_1 | Starting mock Lambda service (http port 4574)... https://github.com/localstack/localstack A very simple Go Lambda mkdir task; cd task; vim task.go creates a directory/package and file with the same name to be the lambda code package main import ( \"fmt\" \"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda\" ) // MyEvent is a thing type MyEvent struct { Name string `json:\"name\"` } // HandleRequest for an event func HandleRequest ( name MyEvent ) ( string , error ) { return fmt .

Development and Software Engineering Roles","text":"Career Development is Vague but Heavy It can be vague where someone's career was before they met you and how they view their long term ambitions. And when the work is getting done now it is easy to understand why future Career Development is one of the overlooked aspects of management. Knowledge workers have a lot of job choices: if their current trajectory won't help them meet their life goals they will make changes that may come as an unwelcome surprise to their manager or organization. Aligned interests, beyond salary-for-output (it would be even better if it was compensation-for-outcome) , is one of the simpler ways to improve a product and reduce the costs of turnover. (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams ) When to discuss Career Development One of the best tools for building relationships are 1:1's. (\"Manager Tools\" https://files.manager-tools.com/files/public/product-samples/One_on_One_Shownotes_0.pdf ) At least once a quarter (aka 3 months) a 1:1 session should cover Career Development. (i.e. a regular opportunity to align Company/Team Objectives or Goals with the individual's career) One of the first questions I generally ask is \"Where do you want to be in 2 years?\" 2 years is just long enough to be aspirational but near enough we should be planning together how to get there \"Where\" should not be reductively just about salary, instead it should encompass talent + experience + direction. As a caveat, even the largest companies will not have every type of role possible. A good manager will provide guidance about what is immediately available (and research future possibilities). Great managers grow careers even when it means the outcome will be an individual changing teams or organizations An incomplete list of technology roles There are too many roles related to technology to list them all but here are some important ones... Software Engineer Front End Engineer : works mostly with implementing UserInterface features and bug fixes (frequently using Javascript and including HTML and CSS) Mobile Engineer : sort of a specialist \"front end engineer\" (assuming you agree that the focus is on Users), ideally experience with both iOS and Android but usually specializes in one Fullstack Engineer : someone who can write/fix \"front end\" and \"back end\" code, often a generalist given the necessity of context switching between so many frameworks Backend Engineer : specializing in APIs, Services, and often data storage (i.e. databases, files, etc.) - by contrast less focus directly on Users Web Engineer is a less common title as there is less need to distinguish from a Desktop Engineer =p Software Engineering gradations by years of experience These levels/titles are really fuzzy because the years may more directly relate to time in an organization or specifically to a framework/techstack. Also, with talent and extreme focus/specialization someone within 2 years can be producing at the level of a \"principal engineer\" Junior (<2 years) : focused on implementation under supervision Senior (~between 2 and 5 years) : able to independently gather requirements and run a project from start to finish Principal (>5 years) : influence at the organizational level Generally it gets exponentially harder to \"level up\" (it would be exceedingly rare to have an organization that is all principal engineers) . Interestingly, given the investment in time, training, and supervision required for junior engineers, it is also rare to have a \"pyramid\" shaped engineering organization. One caveat: a Software Engineer will apply best practices in creating solutions and systems (i.e. bigger picture complexity and scale), whereas a Programmer title hints at a more \"limited to code\" role. Example Diagram of Engineering Levels Operations Technology roles supporting the actual running of software and services... SiteReliabilityEngineers (SRE) : automating monitoring and stability as applied expertise via code ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering ) DevOps : automating the operations of systems and services (including monitoring, scripts and code writing, etc.) - leverages Dev skills with Ops experience ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps ) Operations : maintaining services/systems (hopefully still using automation and ideally transitioning to DevOps due to increased scale) System Administrator : manual job of maintaining a small number of (virtual or physical) machines/systems Data Information has to be stored somewhere, this specialization has become even more prevalent with the exponential growth of \"big data\"... Data Scientist : someone who uses mathematical tools like statistics, in conjunction with software and \"big data\", to answer questions (or discover insights) Data Engineer : someone who builds infrastructure and tools that enables \"Data Science\", i.e. pipelines, warehouses DBA (Database Administrator) : someone who manages the data for an organization, often an expert in the tooling and optimization Lateral Moves Sometimes, besides all the levels and specializations, there are changes in career track (significantly different responsibilities and focus) that are big enough to be called a \"lateral move\". Architect : larger systems are inherently complex and designing and communicating the interfaces, especially across multiple teams/services, is an essential \"big picture\" role Having eng experiences leads to designs with fast and effective implementations and prevents \"ivory tower\" Engineering Manager : people are non-deterministic, they cannot be debugged, and yet they are a part of every successful organization. Someone who takes care of people, helps build and keep a team running smoothly, and achieves company outcomes. This is usually the role before Director and VP Having eng experience vastly increases credibility and the ability to estimate and deliver Quality : someone who methodically thinks outside the box and regularly breaks boxes, ideally the most valuable boxes first Having eng experience means awareness of common shortcomings in frameworks/code and certain boundary conditions or real world scenarios (i.e. load) Security : someone who thinks way outside of the box and finds ways to get inside of locked boxes Having eng experience allows for familiarity with architecture/framework/code flaws and automation of exploits Product Manager : someone with passion and organizational skills who drives a product forward into the world Having eng experience allows for clearer and faster scope/timing discussions, and the ability to help the team with design or debugging Designer : someone who loves the User and UI/UX and delivers highly desirable features and products Having eng experience allows for more effective collaboration and reduced time to market Other Important Aspects Career Development is not just getting the next position, it should also be about a lot of qualitative skills that lead to success: Listening : hearing Users, Stakeholders, Teammates, etc. is one of the most important parts of solving the right problems Communication : proposing good solutions, asking hard questions, raising concerns, writing skills Time Management : individual deadlines, team success Interviewing : being an interviewer is a completely different specialization - yet hiring cannot succeed without good technical interviewers Business : understanding impact and the consequences of outcomes Teamwork : multiplying the efforts of those around you For each skill it is worth considering: What is the individual's current level? How important is it to them to improve? What resources can be provided? How will they be encouraged and held accountable for progress? Did I miss something? Are there missing nuances or outright incorrect statements? Of course! =) There is no one-size-fits-all definition to this NP-Hard problem of \"people and organizations over time\" Iterative Improvement on this Article My brash/blunt style is apparent in this article, but for a peek at how much better things get with collaboration and an editor check out the polished version: https://web.archive.org/web/20200415071712/https://blog.helix.com/helping-your-engineers-grow/ Also, I have later stumbled across this similar idea of \"the range of software careers\" done as a podcast back in 2008: https://www.se-radio.net/2008/09/episode-110-roles-in-software-engineering-i/ https://www.se-radio.net/2008/09/episode-112-roles-in-software-engineering-ii/","tags":"leadership","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/career-development-and-software-engineering-roles/"},{"title":"Go FaaS with AWS Lambda","text":"The promise of creating functions that do not require server administration is amazing, the reality though includes a huge maze of vendor specific commands and frameworks (including permissions). Why Function as a Service In many ways most of the work in software engineering is \"accidental complexity\". Deployment. Input/Output Parsing. Monitoring. Logging. etc. The \"web request\" model conquered (much like the historical domination of SQL) in the 90's as networks and the \"inter-network\" became popular (overwhelming the fragmented and isolated vendor specific applications approaches). https://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/8#159 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application#History https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#History Yet what if your problem/data is not an input/output web request? (Yes of course there are GPUs and dedicated co-location centers...) Or what about loads of traffic that spike in very extreme bursts (and diminish to almost nothing)? The allure then is to have a function that runs on demand: truly elastic compute that does not require provisioning a server (not a virtual one and even without a web server). Without mangaing an OS (and all that security headache!) and especially not paying for idle resources but instead only getting/paying for lots of compute when needed. Of course there's no free lunch so as that complexity balloon gets squeezed it is the infrastructure/framework vendor that must \"magically\" provide the input, execute the function, and return the output. The irony of \"serverless\" is that there's still a physical server, drivers, an operating system, and even a web framework, it's just someone else's (problem/revenue). For \"straightforward\" web applications it may make more sense to directly offload the hosting/framework but still be in the same comfortable web server model (like Heroku) https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-and-aws/#tools-to-manage-state-vs-platform-as-a-service https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/go-web-development-and-templates-with-heroku Source Code package main import ( \"context\" \"fmt\" \"time\" \"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda\" ) // MyRequest demonstrates an input value type MyRequest struct { Value string `json:\"value\"` } // MyResponse helps illustrate how AWS Lambda auto type MyResponse struct { Message string `json:\"message\"` Created string `json:\"created\"` } // HandleRequest https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/go-programming-model-handler-types.html func HandleRequest ( ctx context .

You can configure credentials by running \"aws configure\". So in order to have credentials you must create a User in your AWS Account (with programmatic access only) which will generate an API key for you. (I suggest using the WebUI) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-1#/users Do not use your \"Root\" Admin account in AWS for the API credentials, security best practice means creating at least one separate User AWS Permissions and Roles You may have to use the Web UI or some other mechanism to create the IAM role with the correct permissions Gotcha: the minimum permission would be \"lambda:CreateFunction\" https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-1#/policies https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-1#/roles This means the laborious process of creating a Policy that includes all the Lambda permissions (not very secure but it works) iam:PassRole Hilariously the pre-created roles listed in the documentation do not have that specific IAM extra permission, somehow by default an Admin of the account should deploy lambdas? { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"iam:PassRole\", \"lambda:*\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Create an AWS user with API Credentials So in order to have API credentials (~/.aws/credentials) you have already created: A Policy A Role that can use that Policy A Group that has the Policy attached A User that has credentials (and is in the Group) The Actual Create Lambda Command aws lambda create-function \\ --region us-west-1 \\ --function-name ExampleFunction \\ --zip-file fileb://./deployment.zip \\ --runtime go1.x \\ --role arn:aws:iam::1234YOURACCOUNT:role/lambda-all \\ --handler examplebinary fileb format = file binary The JSON response from creating the new lambda function (and uploading the zipped Go binary)... { \"LastModified\": \"2018-06-12T04:55:36.327+0000\", \"Version\": \"$LATEST\", \"FunctionArn\": \"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-1:1234YOURACCOUNT:function:ExampleFunction\", \"MemorySize\": 128, \"Runtime\": \"go1.x\", \"Role\": \"arn:aws:iam::1234YOURACCOUNT:role/lambda-all\", \"Description\": \"\", \"CodeSha256\": \"45R3BZKesxMM3AuZ96lS9UoiOEGX964oHD/J8QQfLfQ=\", \"Timeout\": 3, \"FunctionName\": \"ExampleFunction\", \"Handler\": \"examplebinary\", \"CodeSize\": 2793060 } https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/create-function.html Trigger a Lambda Manually Using the WebUI (AWS Console) you can select the function created with the CLI https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-1#/functions By using the \"Configure test events\" (sometimes a dropdown on the right next to the Test button) You can create a new \"test event\" , in this case a MyRequest (though any arbitrary extraneous JSON will be ignored) { \"value\" : \"john\" , \"key2\" : \"value2\" , \"key1\" : \"value1\" } this test event sends one value and some extraneous JSON keys as input to the lambda function { \"message\" : \"hi john\" , \"created\" : \"2018-06-12T04:34:22Z\" } the lambda function output is automatically converted from an object to JSON Note that the WebUI also provides a way to upload a newer definition of the lambda function (zipped in a file) Lambda Cron aka CloudWatch Scheduled Events The real power of AWS Lambdas involves how it becomes glue for connecting lots of other AWS services (and transformations). For example CloudWatch can be used to schedule/trigger a lambda. In the WebUI you can add a trigger via the Designer (on the left) Select \"CloudWatch Events\" -> Configure triggers (scroll down) -> Create a new rule Configure a trigger, \"Scheduled\" (as opposed to Rate which is similar but different ;) Name: \"examplecron\" cron(16 * ? * MON-FRI *) This would be on the 16th minute every hour every day every month on Monday through Friday (every year) cron(Minutes Hours Day-of-month Month Day-of-week Year) Disabling the \"example\" Cloud Watch Event is as easy as toggling a radio button (this is an interesting way of controlling how/when your function executes) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tutorial-scheduled-events-schedule-expressions.html Lambda Monitoring In the same WebUI where you view the Lambda function (by name) you can click on Monitoring and click around to see Metrics (i.e. Lambda Cron aka CloudWatch Scheduled Events) actually \"invoked\" your function. Of course if you haven't enabled CloudWatch Logging or more importantly created a \"Log Group\" then you get nothing. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html More Info on Lambdas Here's a full source code example: https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/aws-go-lambda Compare the unit tests to those from a full web server handler: https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/go-web-example/blob/master/controller_test.go Apparently in order to test the tight integration with using AWS Lambda to consume events from other AWS Services there's a tool: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/08/introducing-aws-sam-local-a-cli-tool-to-test-aws-lambda-functions-locally API Gateway As a pre-requisite (and to leverage the fully integrated nature of the AWS ecosystem) we will create some data first... And of course create a new Role that is linked to a Policy =( https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-1#/roles Ensure you have a new Role (confusingly in the UI click through as a Lambda Service needing access) and choose the predefined Policy \"AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess\" arn : aws : iam :: 123476797434 : role / DynamoDBFull Of course you'll have your own unique ARN and Security best practice would involve defining a more precise role (i.e. not giving permission for Auto Scaling) Modify whom can assume the Role (using the AWS Web UI Console) https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-1#/roles/DynamoDBFull?section=trust If you receive an error later on it will be because of the Edit Trust Relationship, \"API Gateway does not have permission to assume the provided role\" { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": [\"apigateway.amazonaws.com\", \"lambda.amazonaws.com\"] }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] } Click on \"Update Trust Policy\" Readonly via DynamoDB Use the WebUI (console) to create a new table https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-west-1 Create a table named: stocks Primary Key: symbol (string) Sort Key: timestamp (number) Uncheck Auto Scaling \"Read capacity\" and \"Write capacity\" checkboxes Do not use the default settings, we will disable autoscaling in order to save money and somewhat arrive at fixed cost https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AutoScaling.Console.html#AutoScaling.Console.Modifying https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes (Note that types are quite specific in DynamoDB, e.g. the binary \"scalar\" value can only contain up to 400KB of base64 encoded data) After a few minutes of initialization select the \"Items\" tab then the \"Create item\" button to manually create an entry: https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-west-1#tables:selected=stocks;tab=items In the Web UI you will have to choose the dropdown (upper left) and change it from \"Tree\" to \"Text\" in order to enter a price { \"symbol\" : \"VFINX\" , \"timestamp\" : 1529697600 , \"price\" : 255.44 } Using a historical stock price (in dollars) at the close of business (Adding a second entry for 1529611200 and 254.95 can be helpful too) After clicking Save and possibly a \"Refresh data from server\" (arrow lines in a circle on the right) you will see the new entries. Setup a new API Gateway connected to DynamoDB https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=us-west-1#/apis/create \"New API\" API Name: stocks Endpoint Type: regional Actions (Resource Actions) -> Create Resource Resource Name: stock Resource Path: /{symbol} Click \"Create Resource\" to save. Actions (Resource Actions) -> Create Method (a dropdown appears in the WebUI below /{symbol}) , choose \"GET\" Integration type: AWS Service Region: us-west-1 AWS Service: DynamoDB HTTP Method: POST (for interactions with DynamoDB) Action Type: Use action name Action: GetItem Execution role: arn:aws:iam::123476797434:role/DynamoDBFull Content Handling: Passthrough The permissions/role ARN was created earlier and GET using POST is actually for interacting with DynamoDB Click on the \"Integration Request\" for the /{symbol} - Get Scroll all the way to the bottom and expand \"Body Mapping Templates\" so that you can click on \"Add mapping template\" Content-Type: application/json Confusingly after you create your type you must click on it to get a UI to define the JSON transformation, use the following: { \"TableName\": \"stocks\", \"Key\": { \"symbol\": {\"S\": \"$input.params('symbol')\"}, \"timestamp\": {\"N\": \"1529697600\"} } } } Emulating a direct low level request https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.LowLevelAPI.html Back at the Web UI for \"/{symbol} - GET - Method Execution\" there is a button \"TEST\" that allows for validation of the API Gateway. This is helpful for detecting early the inevitable bugs that crop up. (Note: it does not seem to me that debugging an API this is way is actually faster...) In the Test UI enter the stock symbol \"VFINX\" underneath {symbol} to emulate a GET request, then click on the \"Test\" button. The Response Body on the right shows the response (that the client would see - though often revealing an error directly from DynamoDB) Careful readers will notice that the timestamp variable is hardcoded in the transformation, todo: make the timestamp part of the query parameter\" Where is the Code? One thing that is missing from this trivial example is how version control is applied to ensure deterministic change (and best practice reviews). Rather than just using the WebUI we should leverage \"Infrastructure as Code\" like CloudFormation but I would suggest more complete tools like: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/guides/serverless-with-aws-lambda-and-api-gateway.html https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/ One thing you might notice as you convert API Gateway + Lambda into code is that it begins to look a lot like code you would see in any web application, except that it is in a DomainSpecificLanguage for a specific vendor framework. Comparisons Two things that are practically relevant are: Latency Cost Lambdas will inherently have \"warm up time\" from a \"cold start\", while this can be mitigated (with a canary warmer etc.), if your architecture is deliberately tying together lots of services over the network it may feel slow (and indeterministics). The contrast is to keep more things in memory or co-located in the same server. (Less network calls) Cost is fickle: Lambdas may be much cheaper but if configured incorrectly a DOS attack could create a lot of API Gateway events or CloudWatch logs (so indirect cost escalation). So there are workarounds but investing in them once again means the benefits (reduced overhead) come with a new complexity (and skill set). Google and Azure both provide functions as a service so while it may be possible to get price competition given the vendor lock-in nature switching costs may be non-trivial. Amazon cleverly have a \"free tier\" that covers enough to get developer hobby projects (aka time invested learning = biased professional purchasing choices) which covers everything in this article. https://aws.amazon.com/free/ I have no affiliation with Amazon, Google, etc. From a philosophical perspective the choice is somewhat whether building with predefined vendor blocks (so WebUI or IaaC) is more valuable (time wise)/preferrable than code. Trust Something that underlies all of the AWS Lambda thinking and work is trust in the vendor. Trust in their security practices Trust in their uptime and operations team Trust in their business (both longevity and pricing)","tags":"build-CI-CD-devops","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/go-faas-with-aws-lambda/"},{"title":"Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and AWS","text":"Overview Just like building and maintaining hardware and physical servers by hand is manual drudge work (aka \"toil\"), so is the manual deployment of servers and networking etc. even on \"Infrastructure as a Service\". The \"Infrastructure as Code\" movement emphasizes the value of human time and leverages source code and version control to manage the increasing complexity. (Think of the exponential growth of logical systems with virtualization, cloud services, containers, and micro-services etc.) Imagine a tool to automate deploying and managing virtual infrastructure... While AmazonWebServices CloudFormation works for setting up infrastructure via a config file, the user experience is non-optimal and there is definitely \"vendor-lock-in\". Hashicorp are a trusted brand in DevOps and having produced Vagrant, Packer, Consul, etc. it is easy to pick their Terraform product. I have no affiliation with Hashicorp besides as a user of their software =) While packer can build a single immutable image (an application or component) of a (virtual) server (or container), Terraform is the higher level tool where the full setup including Load Balancer, Database, etc. are managed. Terraform can also maintain \"state\" like replacing servers with (deploying) newer images that were built by packer. The configuration files can be applied to various Cloud and Infrastructure vendors providing some measure of portability.

Templates built into the Go standard library can provide output that is safe from code injection. var indexTemplate = GetIndexTemplate () func myHandler ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { indexTemplate . Execute ( w , NoData {}) } These small changes (var indexTemplate and indexTemplate.Execute) to the previous main.go allows the default web handler (aka controller) to return html indextemplate.go package main import \"html/template\" // NoData is an empty struct as I do not pass anything into the template type NoData struct {} // GetIndexTemplate returns the index.html template https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/#Template func GetIndexTemplate () * template . Template { var indexTemplate = template . Must ( template . New ( \"index\" ). Parse ( `<html><head><style type=\"text/css\"> body{ font-size: 1.9em; } </style></head><body>hi</body></html> ` )) return indexTemplate } The function just returns the rendered template; since it is only called once in main it is not inefficient, and Must will panic if the template has an error go run main.go indextemplate.go allows you to test it locally https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/ Passing Variables to a Template Dynamic, data driven web sites emphasize the power of software to create tables that nobody wants to write by hand. Building on the previous two examples (main.go, indextemplate.go) we now have a variation that passes data to the template. hexcolors.go package main import ( \"fmt\" \"html/template\" \"net/http\" ) // HexColors wraps a list of colors as hexadecimal strings type HexColors struct { Colors [] string } // GetHexTemplate returns the parsed file as a template object func GetHexTemplate () * template . Template { return template . Must ( template . ParseFiles ( \"hexcolorstemplate.html\" )) } func hexController ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { colors := [] string {} for i := 255 ; i <= 16711680 ; i = i * 256 { s := fmt . Sprintf ( \"%06X\" , i ) colors = append ( colors , s ) } data := HexColors { colors } hexTemplate . Execute ( w , data ) } A handler/controller that generates hex color data hexcolorstemplate.html < table > {{range .Colors}} < tr >< td > {{.}} </ td >< td style = \"background-color: {{.}}; \" > __ </ td ></ tr > {{end}} </ table > range iterates and creates a table row for each color , (the html and body is elided, see the previous example) For the full implementation see the web-go code example: https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/web-go/commit/c8636ee4f54ff95d4a804a152954874f5c23b682 go run main.go indextemplate.go hexcolors.go allows you to test it locally, note that you do not have to pass the html template as a parameter More info: https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/#Template.ParseFiles https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2017/using-go-templates/ HTML Template Blocks as Reusable Components Besides dynamic data and tables for \"do not repeat yourself\" there are also structural components that can be deduplicated. Changes in a base html or css template (or common component definition) can therefore reliably be applied to a large number of files. Jinja2 is famous in Python for making it easier to work with websites, here are two different helpful mechanisms in Go: Use the keyword \"define\" to create a fragment that can be explicitly included Use the keyword \"block\" to create a default value that can be overridden the keyword \"template\" loads a template that has been created by a \"define\" indextemplate.go ... func GetIndexTemplate () * template . Template { indexTemplate := template . Must ( template . ParseFiles ( \"base.tmpl\" , \"index.html\" )) return indexTemplate } This replaces the previous examples hardcoded html with a default base.tmpl that is then overridden by the \"define\" block in the index.html file, order matters ! base.tmpl < html >< head > < style type = \"text/css\" > { {block \"style\" . } } body { font-family : \"Georgia\" ; font-size : 1.9 em ; } { {end } } </ style > </ head > < body > {{block \"content\" .}} {{end}} </ body ></ html > The HTML in base.tmpl has a \"block\" that provides a default style, content is an empty \"block\", (clearly you can define variations of bases templates) index.html {{define \"content\"}} hi , try < a href = \"/hexcolors\" > hexcolors </ a > {{end}} The tiny index file heavily leverages the default base template and uses \"define\" to only override the content block go run main.go indextemplate.go hexcolors.go allows you to test it locally, you do not pass the .tmpl nor .html template files as parameters Further illustration by extending the templates usage a little further: hexcolors.go func GetHexTemplate () * template . Template { return template . Must ( template . ParseFiles ( \"base.tmpl\" , \"components.tmpl\" , \"hexcolorstemplate.html\" )) } the template files must exist in the relative path and build in order components.tmpl {{define \"tablestyle\"}} table, th, td { border: 2px solid black; font-size: 2.5em; } {{end}} defining a specific fragment that can be used anywhere hexcolorstemplate.html {{define \"style\"}} {{template \"tablestyle\" .}} {{end}} {{define \"content\"}} < table > {{range .Colors}} < tr >< td > {{.}} </ td >< td style = \"background-color: {{.}}; \" > __ </ td ></ tr > {{end}} </ table > {{end}} the most complex example: the base template content is overridden with a table that gets data at runtime the style definition overrides the base template default style ; it actually gets populated by loading the tablestyle fragment definition go run main.go indextemplate.go hexcolors.go allows you to test it locally, you do not pass the .tmpl nor .html template files as parameters 2 .tmpl files, 2 .html files, 3 .go files Full source code for this example: https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/web-go/commit/b6da397f89c8a6955a30e665ff1aa99be989e5cb For further info and advanced features like cloning: https://github.com/golang/example/tree/master/template https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/#Template.Clone TestDrivenDesign and Gorilla Mux Tests communicate. Use libraries and composition, not frameworks and magic Rather than re-invent the wheel it is useful to leverage well designed libraries to reduce bugs (and repetitive boilerplate code). Gorilla \"mux\" is a great idiomatic Go library for multi-plexing and routing. Designed to be modular to prefer composition we can also choose to leverage the Logging handler.

Given that performance is often implementation dependent and directly related to the data being stored, it makes sense that one must write some of the more common data structures from scratch. While slices (a.k.a. dynamic arrays) are included (as is a double linked list), a Set must be implemented using a map (for the specific type(s) of interest) https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/golang-interfaces-stack-linked-list-queue-map-set/ Some of my favorite data structures are based upon trees... Heap A heap ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29 ) is a tree that maintains a specific property, i.e. the parent is always larger than its children A binary heap (aka \"priority queue\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap ) has some very helpful and efficient qualities, especially when implemented by using an array (using computations leveraging the inherent relationship with powers of 2). For instance, it is possible to use something like heapsort to sort an array in-place. A common use for a min-heap or max-heap is to be able to answer a query in O(1). (The top/first item retrieved is the answer!) And after you get that answer, the next root item you \"pop\" is the next best answer! https://golang.org/pkg/container/heap/ is already included in the standard library =] Binary Search Tree A binary search tree maintains a specific property between all nodes in the tree. This is most often used to keep a collection of items sorted in order. If the tree is balanced ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree ) we can mathematically guarantee the time for various operations. Because each branch splits into 2 it follows intuitively that time bounds are logn (the fancy way of saying the inverse of 2&#94;x) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_logarithm https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/gotree Trie An interesting variation of a tree is a trie that allows for very fast retrieval of information (if it exists) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie A common example is quickly identifying if a string is available (i.e. autocompletion suggestions of words or names, or \"boggle\") (Hence the obvious application of a trie also-known-as a \"prefix tree\") , video of Zelenski at Stanford explaining: https://youtu.be/TJ8SkcUSdbU?t=13m21s https://github.com/johnpfeiffer/gotree Benefits A trie is fast, like O(m) where m = the length of the search string (assuming that m is far smaller than all n keys in the tree) Unlike hashtables no hashing algorithm is required \"intermediate\" or \"subset\" solutions/queries are possible by returning a subtree Iterating through the trie can return the keys in a specific (e.g. alphabetical) order","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/more-go-data-structures-with-heap-and-tree-and-trie/"},{"title":"Working successfully with remote contractors","text":"Some Background It can be challenging to scale up an organization. One choice that can be made is \"full time employee\" versus \"contractor\". Another choice is \"Co-Located\" versus \"Remote\". There are some important considerations with any combination but I'll share my experiences with \"Remote Contractors\". I've worked with remote contractors from Israel, Italy, England, Pakistan, and Ukraine. I've also personally worked as both an on-site contractor and a remote contractor. A contractor is free to take on other client work in parallel or to say no to a project. They may also decide to stop taking new contracts. A long term contractor is incentivized to deliver sustainable value for repeat business. A remote contractor might never be met in-person (instead only via video, chat, email, etc.) - they can be based anywhere in the world. Contractors typically cost less for a short duration (considering the full cost of HR and the interviewing process, employee benefits, cost of office space, etc.) Contractors tend to cost more over a longer duration (i.e. you are paying a premium for the overhead of their company administration, marketing, profit margin, etc. , though it still might be absolutely less than an employee) Contracts and payments can be tricky, especially across international borders, though technology and digital payments have made this a lot simpler. Myths The following are some of the many negative things I've heard: Outsourcing is evil and consultants and contractors are the most expensive way to ruin your business =( Foreigners are hard to understand and work with You should only hire contractors for a specific task Remote workers are virtual and so they don't matter as much Contractors, especially remote ones, will never be as passionate and invested as your employees A story with a happy ending Of my many experiences I'll share a recent one where I've had fabulous success with some contractors in Ukraine. We started with three open positions and had a happy coincidence that a potential team lead contractor was in the Bay Area finishing a different assignment. The in-person interview went well (communicated well, strong technical skills, showed ambition and experience with leading a team). I interviewed him just like I would any new employee/team member. In the next phase I immediately encouraged this first contractor, our remote team lead, to be engaged in the interviewing of the remaining two members. (After all, they'd be on his team!) I then received resumes from each prospective candidate he'd already reviewed/interviewed. Next I had a conference call with each candidate where again I focused on communication, experience, and ability. Once we got the team assembled we codified on a Monday weekly meeting that fit in the narrow window of time that accomodated the 10 hour timezone difference. All other coordination would be through Confluence, Pull Requests, HipChat (chat and, and of course, if needed, video call). I gave them an example of the work I had done already for the task and asked about their experiences with different solutions/technology choices (test automation and Selenium). I also worked with them to create an inventory of the test coverage. Each week we would discuss the current progress and if there was a change in priority (i.e. a critical security release requiring extra help with manual validation). After a year it became a clear success: productive part of the team, doubled their head count, and allowing us to ship with more confidence faster than ever before. Some of the trust has been having them own their portion of the system (CI and Automated Testing), very often when they bring up a bug or the tests fail we have to listen: delegation means trusting. The timezone difference is still hard and they maintain their own Kanban board even though they participate in the common sprint planning meeting. As they've learned our problem domain and culture they have grown to proactively solve problems (like a hackathon where they wrote an API library for testing, or their extension into performance testing, and many other additions). We could not have hired as many full time employees so quickly nor with their specific expertise: our success is due to their success. Things I've learned to succeed Especially: Ensure there is clear Communication Have a regular meeting (I find weekly is the best cadence) to make sure progress is being made on the correct things and identify any \"blockers\" Prepare written agendas, repeat any decisions made in writing Verbally (Video Conference is preferred for visual cues) for \"high bandwidth\" back and forth, give them an opportunity to ask questions! Provide asynchronous tools to overcome timezone differences (HipChat/JIRA/Confluence) Have a clear idea of exactly what you want them to achieve (talk through your \"definition of done\") Specifically: People and Organization Be involved and engaged in the interview process - your people and team are the largest factor for success or failure Trust is earned over time and is the most valuable component (especially when remote) You must give trust to receive trust For hiring a remote team lead: prefer communication and then organization skills and finally technical skills - remember this person must overcome language/cultural barriers Setup a remote hierarchy: they need to be able to resolve questions and become unblocked quickly via a local escalation process (i.e. a single decision maker in their office/timezone) Don't be afraid to \"lose a week\" for them to learn something, research an approach, or just because of a misunderstanding (this is normal and it only feels more expensive than an \"internal employee\" because you actually get to see a bill for it) Provide open ended goals (don't micromanage and over-prescribe) and people will often exceed expectations Being nice is a universal truth Things to watch out for Clearly not everything leads to success, here are some important considerations: Things that materially affect your user count or bottom line may need a stronger compliance/auditing chain than contracting firms can provide Misunderstandings can turn into personal conflicts if not managed correctly Beware slipping into an \"us and them\" mentality or \"throwing it over the wall\" or \"finger pointing\" Skills may not always match up and it's rare remote contractors will directly interact with your customers - don't create unwinnable situations Be careful when using contractors for critical path projects or key competitive intellectual property: - You are betting your project/company success on a group that has more external risk and less alignment - They may be pressured into taking shortcuts and are less likely to have to \"pay\" the long term costs (e.g. technical debt by skipping tests or large volumes of support tickets) - Slippage and mistakes happen, by keeping it inside your own organization these can be managed quickly and appropriately Things that you can takeaway A foreign contractor can be just a productive as a domestic contractor or employee despite language, geography, cultural, calendar, and timezone differences. A good contractor is like finding a needle in a very large haystack so put in the effort to keep them happy. Contractors are people: Personalize the relationship because you should get to know them: their interests, strengths, weaknesses, etc. Find how they complement your team and give them a path to grow as professionals Respect that they have national/religious holidays and personal lives Look to align their interests with yours, there has got to be more than \"it's just about the money\"","tags":"leadership","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/working-successfully-with-remote-contractors/"},{"title":"Golang Buffalo Tutorial To Create A Web Site With Authentication","text":"Go's considerable tooling makes it a very productive and performant static language.

Caching is often viewed as a performance optimization but sometimes it is the only way to achieve a result in a finite amount of time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming is about breaking down a problem into sub-problems where each solution can be stored so that it can be looked up rather than recomputed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization is related in that it is about storing the output of a function call when specific parameters are provided. Thus it is often conceptualized as a special kind of caching. Naive Fibonacci Recursion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number is a classic numerical series where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13... An interesting problem is to calculate the series up to a certain point. The straightforward solution uses recursion: package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main () { fibSeries ( 37 ) } func fibSeries ( n int ) [] int { a := make ([] int , n ) for i := 1 ; i <= n ; i ++ { a [ i - 1 ] = fib ( i ) } return a } func fib ( x int ) int { if x < 2 { return x } return fib ( x - 1 ) + fib ( x - 2 ) } go run main.go Each iteration in the series discards the previous results and then re-calculates the intermediate steps for each subsequent iteration Fibonacci timings and golang playground time is frozen https://play.golang.org/p/esejwsN0lQ is an example with timings but... ...sorry, the Go Playground does not really use time (and caches all output) so to really see the difference you must run the program locally (Andrew Gerrand explains)... https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/Dh0P1VzXmq8 https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/NLZJahiMk58 https://github.com/golang/playground/blob/master/sandbox/play.go http://www.gophercon.in/blog/2015/02/17/andrew/ https://talks.golang.org/2014/go4gophers.slide#3 Memoization aka Caching with Fibonacci It almost seems common sense that we should not be re-calculating answers that we already know for every step... func fibSeriesMemoization ( n int ) [] int { a := make ([] int , n ) m := make ( map [ int ] int ) for i := 1 ; i <= n ; i ++ { a [ i - 1 ] = fibMemo ( i , m ) } return a } func fibMemo ( x int , m map [ int ] int ) int { if x < 2 { m [ x ] = x return x } _ , ok := m [ x - 1 ] if ! ok { m [ x - 1 ] = fibMemo ( x - 1 , m ) } _ , ok = m [ x - 2 ] if ! ok { m [ x - 2 ] = fibMemo ( x - 2 , m ) } return m [ x - 1 ] + m [ x - 2 ] } Using a map as a lookup table caches the result of each function call during each iteration https://play.golang.org/p/Wxgl_OwkTY again provides the full code (despite the Go playground not really providing time elapsed) That's it: identifying the extra work and storing it somewhere that can be referenced, the trade-off is now that more memory is required. =] Dynamic Programming with Fibonacci Numbers This alternative implementation removes the recursion (and helper function) and instead uses a simple for loop and a slice of ints. It highlights the nuance of how Dynamic Programming is not necessarily just storing the result of a function call but genuinely understanding the nature of the problem. func fibDynamic ( n int ) [] int { a := [] int { 1 } if n == 1 { return a } a = append ( a , 1 ) if n == 2 { return a } for i := 2 ; i < n ; i ++ { a = append ( a , a [ i - 2 ] + a [ i - 1 ]) } return a } this trivial example also benefits from the slice index corresponding well to a key for each fibonacci value in the \"lookup table\" The example Dynamic Programming solution avoids the map lookup and so should be the most performant https://play.golang.org/p/VY9ul6ievC , but since the Go Playground time elapsed does not work... Comparing with Benchmarks Besides the \"manual performance testing\" with time and print statements you can use Go's more sophisticated tooling with bench. Create main_test.go and run go test -v -run=NOMATCH -bench=BenchmarkFibonacciSeries func BenchmarkFibonacciSeriesRecursive ( b * testing . B ) { for n := 0 ; n < b . N ; n ++ { fibSeriesRecursive ( 20 ) } } func BenchmarkFibonacciSeriesMemoization ( b * testing . B ) { for n := 0 ; n < b .

Thus I recommend pen and paper (or whiteboard) for diagramming the tree of (usually recursive) calls in order to see any patterns. The tradeoff of memory for computation (time!) is usually worth it given modern large amounts of cheap memory available (assuming we do not have to worry about cache invalidation ;). https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/caching-data-and-common-gotchas-and-an-intro-to-redis-memcached-and-varnish/ Further exercises: the coin problem (do not need to re-calculate the sub problems) , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem towers of hanoi instructions series (rotate previous instructions rather than full recursion) , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/dynamic-programming-and-memoization-and-the-compute-versus-storage-tradeoff/"},{"title":"Productivity is a Myth","text":"Productivity is dependent on and interwoven with so many things that anytime anyone pushes \"more productive\" I wonder... If you're \"productive\" and you get 3 things done in a day, or in a week even... The Many Measures of Productivity Were the 3 things done actually the important ones? (i.e. do they create value ? reduce drag or improve velocity?) How are you able to actually measure the effect/impact of the 3 things? Against what baseline and over what time period? Do those 3 things even matter if the market suddenly shifted away from your product/segment/industry? Do they contradict previous features/changes? (i.e. did they create confusion rather than clarity?) Were 3 things being compared to 1, or were they being compared to 30? (If expectations aren't correctly set and met you cannot ever be \"productive\") Does anybody even know that you did those 3 things? (\"if a tree falls...\" and \"success has many fathers\") Hidden Costs When getting 3 things \"done\", did you ignore the cost of quality? Does it actually solve the intended problem? Are there unacceptable side effects or regressions? Do you even want to know the answers to the previous two questions? Without test automation you probably have a feature or code that cannot be validated: How will this value persist when the next bug fix or refactor occurs? With code that is unreadable and therefore unmaintainable: Will the next developer be unable to fix a bug or maybe just removes the code entirely? Will you be unable to grow your organization as you cannot find anyone to work on your codebase anymore? Did these changes dramatically increase the complexity of the architecture or the product? spaghetti-ball-of-mud-rube-goldberg-birth-of-a-blackhole? Was this \"done\" at the expense of burnout of an individual or the team? Who will continue development of the feature or product? How do these changes affect operational complexity or cost? Does crashing often or going bankrupt faster count as productivity? Is this just squeezing the complexity bubble or shifting the burden? In \"getting things done\" did you burn bridges within your organization? What about partners or existing customers? Did you make a small subset happier at the expense of a much larger group? What about the future, did you just trade loyal customers for a new ephemeral cohort? John's Phases of Value Least Valuable an unshared idea a proposal a plan some code a pushed commit in testing in a branch reviewed and merged to master testing the deployment (alpha) released and distributed experimental usage with feedback (beta) stable usage Most Valuable Things become more valuable as they become more real (becoming widely distributed/adopted for more people is a kind of proof that it actually solves a problem) Traditional Methods of Productivity There are amazing methods and techniques to \"sustainably\" and reliably create the \"right thing\" that is the \"tipping point feature\" of a \"killer app\" where you can measure and watch your key metrics and indicators go \"up and to the right\". \"Everyone loves a winner\" and survivor bias certainly helps but... The simplest way, in our capitalism-with-money-as-a-fungible-intermediary, is to receive dollars. :$ Yup, very crass, and a \"lagging indicator\" that is not nearly as exciting as \"clicks\" or \"eyeballs\" or \"MAU/DAU/HAU\", but... Monthly Active Users, Daily Active Users, Hourly Active Users, etc. When you get people to part with their money you have definitely convinced them of some value Organizations that have lasted longer, with the same people in them, are more likely the ones that have figured out a process for delivering value. But maybe, instead of focusing on being productive, you should figure out how to get old and rich. =p Doing Something Different While imitation is the sincerest form of attempting to copy someone else's financial success, competition in a \"race to the bottom\" can turn a \"win-win\" into a \"zero-sum\" and then a \"lose-lose\".

This means adding unit tests (test_main.py) and then running them by updating bitbucket-pipelines.yml - python test_main.py It is also possible to keep extending the work required by installing any requirements.txt dependencies (i.e. only required for testing) or running post deployment end-to-end smoke tests.

Use gcloud app create to initialize an App Engine application within the project. You need to create the initial app engine project, either with the WebUI https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/start?project=bitbucket-pipelines or using the GCloud CLI You will need to be prompted for your region, i.e. us-central \"Does not contain a valid app engine project\" Most likely the app.yaml has deprecated fields or invalid characters \"does not contain an App Engine application.\" Most likely the app.yaml has deprecated fields or invalid characters, or maybe missing a main.py altogether \"ERROR: The [application] field is specified in file [/opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build/app.yaml]\" This is because previously app.yaml included \"application\" and \"version\" but those lines are now deprecated, delete them \"You do not have permission to access app \" Most likely the Role of \"App Engine Admin\" still needs to be added, use the IAM for the project to update the Permissions e.g. https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam/project?project=bitbucket-pipelines Or ensure you have an API key generated and added to the Bitbucket Pipelines environment ... or delete all API keys and service accounts and do them again (because it seems to get stuck if you have encrypted API key or something) https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=bitbucket-pipelines https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/project?project=bitbucket-pipelines \"Caller does not have storage.objects.list access to bucket staging.bitbucket-pipelines.appspot.com.\" Ensure the Role \"Storage Object Admin\" was added to the Roles during creation, see above This guy got really close and helped me find the hint about Storage Object Admin: http://www.deadunicornz.org/blog/2017/01/31/travis-ci-and-deploying-golang-apps-to-gae/ Using Docker with Bitbucket Pipelines I could reduce the time required to build (and decouple the build stages) by using a Docker image that already contains the GCloud SDK. This also extends the flexibility if part of your build flow is to build and tag a Docker image as an artifact that can be used for multiple tests (i.e. parallelization) and especially if you are already using Docker in Production.

One of the simplest ways to prevent hacking, keep data secure, and increase privacy is to never have the data leave its place of origin. Homes, and more importantly businesses, will not want every camera, microphone, and sensor sending data into \"The Cloud\" to centralized (and often vulnerable) warehouses. Instead there is an opportunity for businesses and technology that leverage cheap compute to create \"mini private clouds\" . The slow deprecation of SMTP and HTTP (both unencrypted plaintext) being the backbone of the internet will be increasingly replaced with secure alternatives (encrypted, dedicated networks, extra authentication layers like 2FA and MFA) to create virtual tunnels .

This article captures some of the basics and I hope to someday write a follow-up article on more advanced topics. \"Go is a compiled, concurrent, garbage-collected, statically typed language\" https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article Distributed systems and large data sizes mean developers are forced to think in parallelism, or are they? Using Go channels (based upon Communicating Sequential Processes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes , http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf ) developers can write code that feels very imperative and sequential, but designed in such a way that parallelism comes easily. https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism Go and Goroutines A goroutine is a \"lightweight thread\" that allows for a far higher amount of concurrency than just depending on OS processes or even traditional threading (and much simpler than attempting to explicitly organize around a defined number of processors or threads). In a very meta sense every Go program uses concurrency because the main function itself is an implicit goroutine (and will not wait or might block forever ;) package main import ( \"fmt\" \"time\" ) func example () { time . Sleep ( 1 * time . Second ) fmt . Println ( \"example\" ) } func main () { go example () fmt . Println ( \"done\" ) } This will exit without printing \"example\" because using the \"go\" keyword runs the example function in a new goroutine https://play.golang.org/p/h6_B0whHxE https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Main http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads There is no explicit external management of a goroutine once it has started, terminating a goroutine is implemented via an exception or exit in the code that the goroutine is running, usually signalled via a channel Since Goroutines are cooperative they are not pre-empt-able... https://dave.cheney.net/2016/12/22/never-start-a-goroutine-without-knowing-how-it-will-stop https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing) https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10958 Sync with a WaitGroup The most straightforward way to fix the previous trivial example is to specify in advance that the implicit main goroutine should wait before continuing... package main import ( \"fmt\" \"sync\" \"time\" ) func example () { time . Sleep ( 1 * time . Second ) fmt . Println ( \"example\" ) } func main () { var wg sync . WaitGroup wg . Add ( 1 ) go func () { example () wg . Done () }() wg . Wait () fmt . Println ( \"done\" ) } The example function remains unchanged The waitgroup will expect one call of \"Done\" The go keyword now calls an anonymous function that calls wg.Done() (accessed using closure) after example() The waitgroup.Wait() blocks until the correct number of Done() calls have been made The example function sleep and print finally finish The waitgroup unblocks and the main goroutine can finally print \"done\" and exit https://play.golang.org/p/p0jDoiGBT4 https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#example_WaitGroup Channels Channels are the recommended way of communicating when using goroutines (and sharing resources). <- the arrow always points to the left package main import ( \"fmt\" \"time\" ) func main () { c := make ( chan int ) go func () { fmt . Println ( \"sleeping...\" ) time . Sleep ( 1 * time . Second ) c <- 42 close ( c ) // IF NOT CLOSED THEN DEADLOCK // c <- 2 DO NOT SEND TO A CLOSED CHANNEL, IT WILL PANIC }() fmt . Println ( \"anonymous function, a channel passed a value via closure\" , <- c ) v , ok := <- c fmt . Println ( v , ok ) } since a channel is a reference type \"make\" is used and the <- sends a value to the channel, later <- is used to receive a value a closed channel cannot be written to further and will PANIC \"send on a closed channel\" if you forget to close a channel, later reading from an open unbuffered channel which does not have data will exit \"fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\" an \"unbuffered\" channel \"blocks\" until both the sender and receiver are ready the Println function reads from the channel, in this case the channel acts as a synchronization tool that blocks at the Print statement and prevents the main goroutine from exiting The final printed output will be: \"0 false\", since the channel is closed and empty subsequent receives will return a the empty value \"zero\" and the state of the channel (in this case \"false\") https://play.golang.org/p/RR0PWmAeKa https://gobyexample.com/channels https://dave.cheney.net/2013/04/30/curious-channels Buffered channels and returning a value A common problem is one part of the application running faster than another part and one way to \"unblock\" the fast part is to use a buffer to create a queue for the slower part to catch up. This kind of issue occurs in a \"pipeline\" of producers/consumers (also known as sources/sinks)... package main import ( \"fmt\" \"log\" \"sync\" \"time\" ) func slowReceiver ( c <- chan int , wg * sync . WaitGroup ) { for { n := <- c fmt . Println ( \"received\" , n ) time . Sleep ( time . Second ) // c <- 42 // THIS WOULD CAUSE AN ERROR \"(send to receive-only type <-chan int)\" wg .

WaitGroup c := make ( chan int , 3 ) go slowReceiver ( c , & wg ) fastSender ( c , & wg ) wg . Wait () log . Println ( time . Since ( start )) } This example shows how to specify a channel of type that either only sends or only receives log works the same as fmt and Since() a very convenient way to output elapsed time Without the waitgroup Wait() main would exit after 1 second with only \"received 1\" and never reach \"received 4\" (5 seconds) https://blog.golang.org/pipelines https://play.golang.org/p/NcEOgCiSQs https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/3 Using Select to not block a channel Channels are most useful when they can block asynchronously until an event occurs. package main import \"time\" import \"fmt\" func main () { c := make ( chan string ) q := make ( chan bool ) go myDelayedQuit ( q ) go mySleep ( c , 1 ) fmt . Println ( \"begin non blocking wait...\" ) for { select { case msg := <- c : fmt . Println ( \"received:\" , msg ) case <- q : fmt .

Sleep ( time . Second * 2 ) b <- true } for loops forever until the return statement select will wait and whenever a case can be filled it will unblock after 1 second the sleep function is done and sends the \"woke up\" message after 2 seconds the true boolean is sent and main finishes https://play.golang.org/p/JBrhHZVq6a Real Example of Concurrency in a LAN Scanner A real world example is discovering all of the hosts listening on a given port in local area network (subnet). In a serial example waiting 2 seconds for each host to respond would mean waiting 512 seconds in a \"normal\" /24 subnet of ~256 hosts (ignoring the .255 broadcast and .0) found := make ( chan IPCheckResult , max ) var wg sync . WaitGroup wg . Add ( max ) for _ , a := range addresses { fmt . Println ( \"checking\" , a ) // https://golang.org/doc/faq#closures_and_goroutines go func ( ip string ) { checkIP ( ip , * port , found ) wg . Done () }( a ) } wg . Wait () close ( found ) Here the channel is simply used as a \"lock free\" place to aggregate all of the results of the goroutines, sync occurs via the waitgroup which will wait until every pre-added item is decremented by a Done(), there is definitely a possibility for an off-by-one gotcha that will hang your program! https://bitbucket.org/johnpfeiffer/go-lanscan/src Troubleshooting Race Conditions A common gotcha is that in Go maps are not safe for concurrent use: https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action https://golang.org/doc/faq#atomic_maps In this example of a simple in memory cache the expiration was implemented... func ( memory MemoryCache ) Set ( key string , value string , expiresSeconds int ) { memory . m [ key ] = value timer := time . NewTimer ( time . Duration ( expiresSeconds ) * time . Second ) go func () { <- timer . C memory . Delete ( key ) // log.Println(\"Timer triggered cache expiration for\", key) }() } The error here is that the goroutine that wakes up to \"expire\" and remove a key/value pair from the map may contend with any other later operation (i.e. Get, Set, Delete) that is also modifying the map https://bitbucket.org/johnpfeiffer/go-cache/src A really helpful tool is to run go test -race , it may take a little bit but \"WARNING: DATA RACE\" is pretty clear. https://blog.golang.org/race-detector More random thoughts on concurrency and control Controlling goroutines is like controlling threads or even any other control flow. Iterative vs Recursive calculation of factorial means either predetermined count of iterations or an indeterminate count (recursion) with a (base case) signal for termination (often called a sentinel value). So either the External Controller knows when to stop or each actor checks if it is time to stop. An important consideration to termination is cleanup If the actor is responsible for self cleanup (as it knows what resources it is using) this can lead to resource leaks if the actor terminates unexpectedly without cleaning up. If using \"dependency injection\" then the Controller has knowledge of what resources were shared with the agents and can do cleanup, even if actors terminate unexpectedly. An increasingly common approach is for the Framework to facilitate cleanup so that the complexity is removed from both the Controller and the actors (e.g. Garbage Collection or Go deferred) Poison Jobs cons and pros One challenge with workers and a queue is the \"poison job\" which may create inefficiency or halt the system entirely as each worker who takes the job blocks/loops forever or terminates unexpectedly. One possible solution is to have a retry count so that any job which has timed out or failed and retried repeatedly is moved to a FailedJob queue (for future manual inspection and debugging) or logged and dropped entirely. Interestingly something like a \"poison job\" is actually a useful way to signal to concurrent actors to have an orderly termination even if they have not completed their jobs (i.e. a full system shutdown has been initiated and we want to trigger self cleanup). Patterns for Channels and Flow Control Go Channels represent a way to map out the dependencies and then allow the compiler to optimize for parallelization. Waiting indefinitely for all goroutines to return is naive, and any termination signal must have the ability to truly interrupt work in progress, which it does NOT for goroutines, so any call that a goroutine is making MUST have a timebound where it can check for the termination signal. Therefore write your goroutines carefully knowing that you cannot cancel/aka force them to return from an infinite loop/long call, unless you exit main entirely. This means that for architecture decisions it is important to consider small separate services/applications that can provide resource usage transparency and termination control. While this is becomes a tradeoff with coordination/orchestration complexity it is worth having modularity and clear boundaries in any application of decent complexity. Simple and deterministic: fan out with predefined count, close the channel Provide timeouts and retries: a failure can occur anywhere and graceful degradation means setting limits and dealing with ephemeral errors Use the select statement for a non-blocking way to check for early application termination events Use buffers to even out spikes in work from sources/production https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/10/the-behavior-of-channels.html","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/golang-concurrency-goroutines-and-channels/"},{"title":"Code is for Humans","text":"Code is the automation of a solution I often feel like the purpose of Programming is lost in the many discussions and debates about Programming. Sometimes the code is conflated as being the solution. Whatever problem is being worked on has to be thought through and different possible solutions evaluated. Then one approach has to be implemented and tested. That implementation can take many forms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness Alternatively a solution is seen as perfected because it is written in code. Yet all it takes is one more edge case, one more nuance on a variable, and the \"solution\" will fail. (Bugs!) Perhaps this is because the trivial examples of coding are often related to math, like adding two numbers, that we are somewhat misled to believe that the correct code will always solve the problem (and amplified by Computer Science which uses proofs to mathematically prove algorithmic solutions). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem Selecting the correct algorithm assumes understanding of the problem, the constraints, and of course the end goal. Much like picking an off-the-shelf tool or open source library or framework, there has to be some comprehension of whether their solution is your solution. The purpose of the automation is to repeatedly solve the problem (assuming the same environment and same inputs). So first you really have to sit down and think through the solution. Usually this involves pen (or pencil) and paper though the whiteboard is certainly one of my favorites. I certainly understand people who want to work towards solutions by coding (i.e. the IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment and programming paradigm as just another tool for our brains) but I suspect it can also lead to distractions of accidental complexity (limitations or unfamiliarities of the programming language syntax/framework) and sometimes worse yet unnoticed biases of the tools preclude some of the best solutions. (The infamous \"imperative vs functional\" debates ;) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming Non trivial problems will require solutions that involve tradeoffs and compromises (i.e. the classic \"execution time\" vs \"resources required\"). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering Code is for humans, not computers Human readable code must be transformed into instructions for a machine which is what executes all of the computations. The machine has no understanding of whether the instructions will solve the problem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code This fundamental impedance mismatch is one of the major challenges to programming. Humans do not always know all of the correct instructions to provide. Machines will faithfully execute whatever is given to them, including conflicting commands or erroneous data. So the history of the abstraction of computer programming very often reads like the evolution away from the physical hardware towards humans expressiveness because the better able we are to describe something the more likely we are to document a correct automation of a solution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages Solving Yesterdays Problems of Performance While the earliest hardwired machines filled large rooms and had different kinds of accidental complexity and bugs https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334663 , later generations had to deal with getting the most performance out of the machines https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Historical_perspective . These powerful low level languages can also generate some of the most persistent and pernicious bugs via manual memory management, pointers, and buffer overflows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation#Common_errors https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Resource The amount of developer time required to create correct code has dramatically reduced as the speed of computation has increased and the tools (including the programming languages) are better able to \"get out of the way\" and avoid the accidental complexity of optimizing for performance. It is rare that the purpose of a program is to add numbers as quickly as possible Programming languages help with explicitness by removing ambiguity in natural languages A sentence in English, \"We saw her duck\", can have multiple meanings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity#Linguistic_forms ) Programming languages force human expressiveness to be less ambiguous (i.e. the responsibility of the mismatch impedance of incorrect instructions falls squarely on the humans). Names are important and should be well thought out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming) Short variables and acronyms can confuse, mislead, or misdirect other humans who will modify or extend code based on that misunderstanding Performance specific changes can become digressions and noise that distract or make brittle the tracing of the required solution logic Explicit communication because magic is incomprehensible The problem with short meaningless variable names in unreadable code littered with performance optimizations is they prevent solving The Problem . Some considerations and anti-patterns: Straight to coding (no research) Real time systems that keep an aircraft in the air must pay attention to runtime constraints Overlooked requirements and misunderstanding the problem domain Not knowing what the correct answer will look like (i.e. not having test/control inputs and outputs) Absence of acceptance tests to prove that it really is solved and the infamous \"it works on my machine\" The fallacy of \"Perfection\"; for a solution to provide value there has to be a mechanism to empirically prove it works \"Done\" is not \"code complete\" (even with tests ;) , it is Integration Tests, Acceptance Tests, Performance Tests, Soak Tests, actually shipped to the \"wild\" where it survives real environments and edge cases Intermittent behavior = automating of a solution should provide consistent results Ideologue = a technology looking for a problem Premature Optimization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize Premature Generalization http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureGeneralization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud Now is the only time that matters, when actually the more successful you are the more likely the code will continue and need maintenance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance Process Improvements to actually Solve a Problem Considering the complexity required to actually solve a problem it would be fair to say many iterations are required.

Data is required to understand progress (or regression). Humans must keep modifying until \"done\" (even in the advanced example of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming ) The steady increase in computing power ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law ) means Maintainability trumps Performance . Being able to get reproducible results was codified long ago in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method . =] Collaboration and Crowdsourcing without Group Think There seems to be a strong reaction to the term \"pair programming\" and it is no uncommon for code reviews and pull requests to be a source of emotional angst and team friction. These techniques are well established ways of improving quality: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pair-programming-whats-in-it-for-me/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control#Pull_requests While the myth of the individual genius over-emphasizes the outlier it is far more common for a group to achieve projects of any large size (even with software and technology acting as a multiplier). I am not advocating pure democracy (or just accepting status quo) as the only way of building things but it is clearly preferrable to have a variety of skills (i.e. architecture, mathematics, verification, design, etc.) It may be that working together on intellectual endeavours is currently less intuitive for humans than working together on physical challenges and that a fledgling industry that is chronically short of trained and experienced workers is not selecting and creating environments that are conducive to group working. One of the most challenging aspects is disambiguating where something has been successful in the field (mature) versus \"it's always been that way\" complacence. Different isn't always better but should always be honestly evaluated. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-10/the-myth-of-the-lone-genius https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity Configuration Patterns Configuration is just another part of \"Do Not Repeat Yourself\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself . Without configuration each program would have to be rewritten with the a new \"configuration\" portion hardcoded each time. (Though software is an improvement over having to build new hardware for each new configuration...) So it is a pragmatic way to extend the utility of an automated solution. \"When should configurations be applied\"? Configuration is passed as a parameter when the program first starts Configuration is loaded from a configuration file when the program first starts Configuration is loaded from Environment variables when the program first starts Configuration is loaded from a configuration file whenever a change to that file is detected by the program Configuration is loaded from a configuration file whenever a module is loaded (i.e. \"lazy loading\") Configuration is loaded from Environment variables whenever a module is loaded (i.e. \"lazy loading\") https://12factor.net/config https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading For a short execution time there is little difference between loading at startup versus runtime What are the impacts of restarting the service (in order to reload the new configuration changes)? Are there parts that have to be loaded first and then wait for a slower dependency to be available? Prefer Determinism for Reasonability Loading and initializing all configuration when the program first starts is one way of attempting to create determinism in the code paths that are running in memory. The benefit of \"hot swapping\" is applying changes to existing code while it is still running. The computer is not going to get confused. It does not care if the data being passed to the module in memory is correct or incorrect, but the new dynamic result may ruin that beautifully automated solution, sometimes in almost undetectable ways. As we humans struggle with ever increasing complexity (both in the software and hardware) we should focus on how to reduce variability (that includes during coding, during compilation, and especially at run time). Some alternatives tend to take advantage of the cheaper cost of computing and increasingly distributed/networked systems: Send a reconnect signal to clients to use a new endpoint Start up a second process and have the operating system pass the network connection from the old to the new process A Load Balancer or other connection holding component that can direct traffic to the new service https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html Modularity Smaller pieces can be easier to understand and assert for validity. The \"Do One Thing\" principle helps the human who is composing a solution (ideally from re-usable components) to understand which tool is right for the job. This also allows for leveraging \"seams\" to investigate or decouple code (which drastically helps with maintenance). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle http://web.archive.org/web/20160803161738/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=359417&seqNum=2 Updating, upgrading, or replacing a well defined component will be easier than something that is tightly interwoven with all of the other pieces. There is a natural tension with re-usability since something with a slight modification that can be re-used reduces the overall code footprint. The key here is a clear understanding of whether the actual test footprint and complexity have been reduced. Also it is possible to decompose into such small parts that they have no logical coherence =[ Immutability One last technique I would like to highlight is immutability. The idea is by preventing change it can be easier to trace and determine the expected outcome. (Or discover the exact point at which there is an unexpected deviation). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ImmutableServer.html http://web.archive.org/web/20161030171510/http://blog.codeship.com/immutable-infrastructure/ It comes at a trade-off of increased resource consumption (i.e. memory) and creating an unmanageablely large number of entities (with possible corresponding orchestration or scale issues) Functional programming definitely tends towards immutability ;)","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/code-is-for-humans/"},{"title":"Security Encryption HTTPS OpenSSL SSH Keygen VPN Letsencrypt Certbot","text":"As our lives become increasingly monitored and digital the privacy of being unobserved or having a private conversation that we used to be able to take for granted now requires extra effort. The more people who choose to use these easy and readily available tools the more privacy will become the standard rather than the exception. Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Using a shared secret key is generally the simplest way to encrypt, both parties use the same key to encrypt and decrypt. Asymmetric encryption (aka \"public and private key\") allows for a message to be encrypted without the parties having to meet or exchange a secret. Both are often used together in a complementary fashion. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security Codes and the ability to communicate in secret have a very long history which many others have documented and thanks to the amazing efforts of many many people we have the ability to communicate our billions of messages with relative privacy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cryptography#Modern_cryptography https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/984428.Crypto (Steven Levy) It is important to understand that good encryption depends on randomness to make it as hard as possible for an \"attacker\" to reverse engineer or guess the key, i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random The following is my summary of some of the most common and useful tools... Pretty Good Encryption for Pretty Good Privacy While there is a lot of value in leveraging the GPG public and private keys for authenticity checking this is just about encrypted data... GPG Encryption gpg -c example.tar.gz prompts for a password to access the keyring and leverages existing (or automatically generates) public and private keys, and outputs example.tar.gz.gpg Note: encrypting before compressing is meaningless since encrypted data is random and compression depends on repetition/patterns gpg --yes --passphrase=password -c example.txt non interactive encryption (if the private key is password protected), outputs example.txt.gpg echo \"password\" | gpg --yes --no-tty --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --output encrypted.txt.gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 plain.txt non interactive AES 256 symmetric cipher rather than public/private keypairs GPG Decryption gpg example.tar.gz.gpg enter the passphrase to access the private key to decrypt the file gpg --yes --passphrase=password example.txt.gpg non-interactively access the private key to decrypt the file echo \"password\" | gpg --yes --no-tty --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --output plain.txt --decrypt encrypted.txt.gpg non interactively decrypt with symmetric encryption Do not pick password as your password ;p https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x110.html AES 256 Encryption AdvancedEncryptionStandard is one of the US and world standards as an encryption algorithm. Security benefits from transparency in that if you provide the algorithm and source code in plain sight and attackers are still unable to decrypt/crack/manipulate the data then you are probably in good shape. Perhaps one of the most well known projects (open source and free!) to advance the practice of encryption is https://www.openssl.org/ Here we encrypt and decrypt a text file: openssl aes-256-cbc -in plain.txt -out message.encrypted prompted for a password (symmetric key) to encrypt the file with AES 256 openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in message.encrypted -out plain.txt prompted for a password to decrypt the message openssl aes-256-cbc -in plain.txt -out message.encrypted -pass pass:YOURPASSWORD non-interactively provide the password to encrypt the file with AES 256 openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in message.encrypted -out plain.txt -pass pass:YOURPASSWORD non-interactively provide the password to decrypt the file with AES 256 an incorrect password will create a zero byte file openssl aes-256-cbc -a -d -in message.encrypted -out plain.txt if it's base64 encoded do not forget the -a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html Generating SSL Certificates and Private and Public Keys Perhaps the most common use of TLS/SSL are the keys used to encrypt communication with a web server, these examples use a \"self signed certificate\" which most libraries and browsers will not trust. \"Root Certificate Authorities\" are the ones you send a \"Certificate Signing Request\" to generate a certificate that can be mathemetically trusted by the existing software libraries and browsers More Private and Public Key basics for SSL Certificates The private key contains a series of numbers. Two of those numbers form the \"public key\", the others are part of your \"private key\". The \"public key\" bits are also embedded in your Certificate (we get them from your CSR - certificate signing request). Verify the SSL Certificate and Private Key match (openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in server.pem | openssl md5 ; openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in server.key | openssl md5) | uniq outputs a single hash if matching, if two hashes are output then it is not unique and the key and cert do not match To check that the public key in your cert matches the public portion of your private key: openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key But since the public exponent is usually 65537 and it's challening to compare a long modulus you can use the following approach: openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in server.crt | openssl md5 openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in server.key | openssl md5 the \"modulus\" and the \"public exponent\" portions of the cert and key ... aka the two md5sum hashes should match Verify the Cert and Intermediate match and then Verify openssl verify -purpose sslserver -CAfile intermediate.pem -verbose server.pem ensure the intermediate certificate matches the SSL certificate (if it does not SSL trust will not work correctly) Verify a CSR matches the Key and Certificate To check to which key or certificate a particular CSR belongs you can compute openssl req -noout -modulus -in server.csr | openssl md5 Creating keys and certificates and certificate requests openssl New Key and Cert One Liner openssl req -subj '/CN=example.com/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US' -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt one liner to generate a self signed SSL key and certificate, since SSL certs are rotated regularly we can use 2048 instead of 4096 bits openssl certificate commands openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key create 2048 bit nopass key + csr (certificate signing request -

So it is really common to need to use it and yet... JSON can be surprisingly difficult in Go because even though it is built into the language it depends already understanding a few other somewhat advanced topics. And the challenge can be compounded by the Go philosophy of \"We Did Not Put It In the Language Do It Yourself\". A quick overview of JSON JSON (I never hear humans actually say the full thing: JavaScript Object Notation , though \"Jason\" does get annoyed) is a way to format data structures as text and it is the modern alternative to XML. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON http://json.org/ There is some fuzziness about Numbers and other definitions but its beauty is definitely simplicity. Why does Go in JSON seem (unnecessarily) advanced or challenging? Go with JSON requires defining/using structs for objects. This upfront cost certainly fits the \"statically compiled\" model ;) But Javascript or Python magically \"just make an object\" (or dictionary) which has fields/values that are very accessible. It is actually pretty common that we might not know or want to define the full (nested?) object structures we've received (as if the JSON format was for portability of data from a service outside of your control), but we're forced to figure something out... To generically parse an object from JSON (i.e. you do not know the full structure) you must use the \"empty interface\" (the most generic object), and Interfaces are more advanced than simply defining structs. Inferring or attempting to lazily load JSON (i.e. a mixed list of different objects - since there isn't a slice of mixed types in Go!) requires Reflection which is a relatively advanced topic for a beginning programmer. Static typing is great, except for when you're reading from JSON and you're not sure which type you should really use and you probably just want it to work simply. This impedance mismatch is natural when moving from a portable data format to a specific language and application, but it doesn't reduce the cursing. To really have the Go compiler figure out the translation between JSON to object requires \"hinting\" which helps with compiling Reflection magic, but starts to complicate your structs (and interfaces!) Nested Structs (fields) are the answer to Nested JSON, but then you have to really figure out how many (and lists with multiple types of objects!) and how deep you expect any nesting you'll receive. (Or just give in to your recursive desires.) Pointers. They are efficient. Since JSON parsing can be memory intensive you will end up using them... in Nested Structs... with Interfaces... and Reflection Hints... (and since Pointers are messy and confusing there will be bugs). associative array < struct/object < interface < pointers < reflection a completely made up ordering of complexity, arrays being the least hard to grok http://research.swtch.com/interfaces https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection To summarize, it is really common to get some json from somewhere from someone else and want to just peek at one field, update another field, add a key and value, and save the json. And that kind of dynamic behavior isn't inherently easy in Go. =[ Example code of Marshalling and Unmarshalling JSON with Go package main import ( \"encoding/json\" \"fmt\" \"io\" \"io/ioutil\" \"log\" \"os\" ) func logIfError ( err error ) { if err != nil { log .

As a pragmatic language designed for developers who ship to production the amount of built in tooling (testing, benchmarks, etc.) is impressive. Taking an earlier example I gave of MergeSort let's examine how TestDrivenDevelopment (or Design) was used to implement it. Small functions make for good tests Small functions are easier to read and code is read 1000 times more often than it is written. (completely made up but believable fact). Less lines of very-readable-code is usually an ok approximation for complexity, and less complexity means your program is easier to reason about (and easier to validate with tests!). Some reasons to not use MEGA-OBJECTS One of the things that TDD helps focus on is modularity and requirements. Two tensions to balance are the needs of the caller versus the needs of the function. What I mean is that the function caller wants to understand what they have to provide and what they'll get back. If the function asks for a MEGA-OBJECT then somehow the caller has to find or create a MEGA-OBJECT (which sounds very expensive). And if the function didn't really need the MEGA-OBJECT then the function will extract the one value it actually needs and throw all that work away. If instead the function asks for the integer primitive that is the value of the MEGA-OBJECT's this should be very easy to fulfill. (Which is how tests help discover this MEGA-OBJECT anti-pattern, because even MEGA-OBJECT mocks are difficult). A second reason to not pass a MEGA-OBJECT is that those are usually \"pass by reference\" for performance reasons and if modifying/side-effects are allowed then the function may accidentally invalidate other values (or intentionally corrupt data or override permissions). The less state being passed around the easier it is to quickly write a large base of non brittle unit tests to isolate exactly where the logic goes wrong when doing \"the simplest thing\" and of course to communicate to others/callers how they might use your function or how it handles failure modes. http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html Example function with go unit tests This example function requires two slices of integers. package main import ( \"fmt\" ) // SlicesMerge takes two sorted slices of integers and merges them into a single sorted slice of integers func SlicesMerge ( a [] int , b [] int ) [] int { s := make ([] int , len ( a ) + len ( b )) for ai , bi , si := len ( a ) - 1 , len ( b ) - 1 , len ( a ) + len ( b ) - 1 ; si >= 0 ; si -- { if ai < 0 { s [ si ] = b [ bi ] bi -- } else if bi < 0 { s [ si ] = a [ ai ] ai -- } else if a [ ai ] > b [ bi ] { s [ si ] = a [ ai ] ai -- } else { s [ si ] = b [ bi ] bi -- } } return s } func main () { a := [] int { 1 , 3 , 5 } b := [] int { 2 , 4 , 6 } fmt . Println ( \"merged:\" , SlicesMerge ( a , b )) } a main function with print statements is the tried and true way of manual testing , go run main.go main_test.go Automated units tests means another developer can fix a bug and ensure it does not regress, read and learn expected behavior, and of course have automated continuous integration catch problems as early as possible, go test package main import ( \"reflect\" \"testing\" ) var nilslice [] int var empty = [] int {} func TestSlicesMergeEmpty ( t * testing .

Parallel . The value of this flag is the maximum number of tests to run simultaneously ; by default , it is set to the value of GOMAXPROCS . Note that - parallel only applies within a single test binary . The ' go test ' command may run tests for different packages in parallel as well , according to the setting of the - p flag ( see ' go help build ' ). Running a specific test go test -v -run TestSlicesMergeHalf Getting verbose output and specifying tests is quite helpful when fixing a piece of code or test. Note the run parameter takes a regular expression Test Coverage Sometimes people talk about \"test coverage\" and while it's clear that 100% coverage is rarely possible (nor entirely desirable from the idea of diminishing returns and exponential growth in integration combinations outside of the simplest function) , it's still a useful metric/tool to discover if there's a chunk of code that's \"whistling in the wind\". go test -cover \"coverage: 75.0% of statements\" Generate a \"coverage profile\" of how many times each statement was run, use the current directory: go test -covermode=count -coverprofile=count.out . ok command-line-arguments 0.004s coverage: 94.7% of statements go test -covermode=count -coverprofile=count.out ./stringsmoar.go ./stringsmoar_test.go Alternatively, pass the name of the package (and test files) go tool cover -func=count.out utilize the \"coverage profile\" to see the coverage breakdown by function bitbucket . org / johnpfeiffer / stringsmoar / stringsmoar . go : 23 : RuneFrequency 100.0 % ... bitbucket . org / johnpfeiffer / stringsmoar / stringsmoar . go : 82 : RemoveNthRune 100.0 % bitbucket . org / johnpfeiffer / stringsmoar / stringsmoar . go : 96 : RemoveNthItem 0.0 % ... bitbucket . org / johnpfeiffer / stringsmoar / stringsmoar . go : 115 : Permutations 100.0 % total : ( statements ) 94.7 % If you have a default browser configured you can use the following: go tool cover -html=count.out to generate a \"heat map\" and see exactly how often each line of code is covered.

I suppose if you recorded every result and ran against exactly the same hardware you might be able to detect performance regressions, though I'd be worried about overly inconsistent/flaky results taking up way too much valuable time. Inside of a _test.go file you can also write benchmark test functions, here is one of the classic questions of \"concatenating strings in Go\" Here we compare the simplest concatenation of two strings and also the continued concatenation of many strings with either + or buffer.WriteString() Create myconcat_test.go and execute the following with go test -v -bench=. package main import ( \"bytes\" \"testing\" ) func MyConcatSimple ( a string , b string ) string { return a + b } func MyConcatSimpleLooped ( a string , b string ) string { for i := 0 ; i < 101 ; i ++ { a += b } return a } func MyConcatBytesBuffer ( a string , b string ) string { var buffer bytes . Buffer buffer . WriteString ( a ) buffer . WriteString ( b ) return buffer . String () } func MyConcatBytesBufferLooped ( a string , b string ) string { var buffer bytes . Buffer buffer . WriteString ( a ) for i := 0 ; i < 101 ; i ++ { buffer . WriteString ( b ) } return buffer . String () } func BenchmarkConcatSimple ( b * testing . B ) { for n := 0 ; n < b . N ; n ++ { MyConcatSimple ( \"foo\" , \"bar\" ) } } func BenchmarkConcatSimpleLooped ( b * testing . B ) { for n := 0 ; n < b . N ; n ++ { MyConcatSimpleLooped ( \"foo\" , \"bar\" ) } } func BenchmarkConcatBytesBuffer ( b * testing . B ) { for n := 0 ; n < b . N ; n ++ { MyConcatBytesBuffer ( \"foo\" , \"bar\" ) } } func BenchmarkConcatBytesBufferLooped ( b * testing . B ) { for n := 0 ; n < b . N ; n ++ { MyConcatBytesBufferLooped ( \"foo\" , \"bar\" ) } } The b.N is automatically filled in by Go until the benchmark runner is \"satisfied with stability\" though you can create a wrapper function for the code under test if you wish to attempt more control over iterations Remember that every benchmark is only valid against a specific set of hardware, operating system, libraries, etc. and with any changes (i.e. upgrade from Go 1.6 to 1.7) you may need to retest... unless you're just proving O(N) is better than O(N&#94;2) ;) Oh right, the results... BenchmarkConcatSimple - 4 30000000 40.1 ns / op BenchmarkConcatSimpleLooped - 4 100000 20728 ns / op BenchmarkConcatBytesBuffer - 4 5000000 373 ns / op BenchmarkConcatBytesBufferLooped - 4 300000 7227 ns / op the iterations show that the simplest naive concatentation with + is very fast for a couple of small arguments (40 nanoseconds) BUT if appending many (100+) items together buffer.Write() is better This example ignored all sorts of real world questions around how the strings are provided (i.e. a slice of strings might be better served by Join()) (or examine it's source code to see how they implement string concatenation!) , or memory consumption, etc. http://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/30/how-to-write-benchmarks-in-go https://medium.com/hackintoshrao/daily-code-optimization-using-benchmarks-and-profiling-in-golang-gophercon-india-2016-talk-874c8b4dc3c5 https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Join Running specific benchmarks go test -v -run=NOMATCH -bench=BenchmarkConcatSimple Since it is using the test runner the -run= regexp not matching allows you to skip any unit tests -bench= can take a regexp to match only a subset of benchmark tests Go Benchmark with an expensive setup If you have some setup (e.g. creating a slice with test data) you probably do not want it inside of the benchmark ;) go test -v -run=NOMATCH -bench=BenchmarkKey func BenchmarkKey ( b * testing .

Basically the idea is to have software run over an extreme range or with randomness and then the edge cases that are discovered can be added into the test suite. It has been used to enormously good effect on the Go standard library by Dmitry Vyukov. One thing you start to see when attempting to apply it is that it really a tool for helping validate handling of a specific input. It is not a magic wand to discover bugs. ;) This kind of tool assisted exploratory testing is usually reserved for a more mature phase of a product (or in special use cases where there is high value in attempting to prove correctness). func TestSlicesMergeRandom ( t * testing . T ) { f := fuzz . New () var randomSeed int f . Fuzz ( & randomSeed ) fmt . Println ( \"random seed:\" , randomSeed ) r := rand . New ( rand . NewSource ( int64 ( randomSeed ))) xLength := r .

Fuzz ( & r ) x = append ( x , r ) } for i := 0 ; i < yLength ; i ++ { var r int f . Fuzz ( & r ) y = append ( y , r ) } sort . Ints ( x ) sort . Ints ( y ) result := SlicesMerge ( x , y ) expected := append ( x , y ... ) sort . Ints ( expected ) if ! reflect . DeepEqual ( expected , result ) { t . Error ( \"\\nExpected:\" , expected , \"\\nReceived: \" , result ) } } Seeding randomness is part of how this gofuzz library is used; the Vyukov version actually produces output that must be parsed separately. https://github.com/google/gofuzz https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-parser-meet-go-fuzzer https://medium.com/@dgryski/go-fuzz-github-com-arolek-ase-3c74d5a3150c# https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/ https://golang.org/pkg/sort/","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/golang-testing-benchmark-profiling-subtests-fuzz-testing/"},{"title":"Golang Interfaces Stack Linked List Queue Map Set","text":"Two of the most useful tools in daily professional programming are hash maps and frameworks for modular abstractions. It's the blend of performance and composability that makes Go an attractive language for getting things done. Maps aka Hash Tables in Go For hash tables basic operations like insert, lookup, delete are basically \"constant time\" in big O notation which makes it the \"go to\" default data structure for a lot of basic coding. That helps avoid having to write and maintain all the complexity and operations of an in-memory sorted data structure. It is also often the desired data structure answer in a programming interview problem =] Here's the basics of using a map since someone else has already done all of the hard work of figuring out the correct math of the hash function to avoid collisions and the engineering behind implementing it in a performant fashion. Using a map in go package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func inSet ( s string , m map [ string ] bool ) bool { // gotcha: do not depend on just the return value but use a the second value which returns in map or not value , ok := m [ s ] fmt . Println ( s , \"has value\" , value , \"and is in?\" , ok ) if ok { return true } else { return false } } func main () { m := make ( map [ string ] bool ) // never use var m map[string]bool because m is nil and assign causes a panic m [ \"foo\" ] = true m [ \"bar\" ] = false fmt . Println ( inSet ( \"foo\" , m )) fmt . Println ( inSet ( \"bar\" , m )) fmt . Println ( inSet ( \"foobar\" , m )) fmt . Println ( len ( m ), \" elements in map\" , m ) delete ( m , \"bar\" ) m2 := map [ rune ] int { 'a' : 1 , 'b' : 2 , 'c' : 3 } for k , v := range m2 { fmt . Println ( string ( k ), v ) } } the two main gotchas for maps in go are to not accidentally assume that the value coming back from a map means that the key was in the map since if the key is not in the map it will return the default \"empty\" value which will be 0 or false, and to not start with a nil pointer since later assignment will cause a panic https://play.golang.org/p/fqvNrELy1S play with maps yourself https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action https://golang.org/src/runtime/hashmap.go#L9 Sets A common question in coding is whether a certain key or object has already been seen before. The lookup cost in a set is cheaper than a full search through a more complex data structure like a binary tree. Golang currently does not have a \"set\" built into the language but given the code example you can see how to quickly achieve the same functionality with a map. This is a common pattern: they keep the language simple and focus on low level components that perform and compose well while we code exactly what we need for a given usage. (i.e. a huge meta \"YouAren'tGoingToNeedIt\") https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type) https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/set.html https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MethodSets Low memory footprint map as a set When implementing a Set, in some cases you can be very parsimonious with memory by using an empty struct. This means you will rely on the very explicit _, ok pattern of checking for presence in the set. package main import ( \"fmt\" \"unsafe\" ) func main () { m := make ( map [ rune ] struct {}) fmt . Println ( m ) m [ 'a' ] = struct {}{} fmt . Println ( m ) fmt . Printf ( \"%#v \\n\" , m ) fmt . Println ( unsafe . Sizeof ( m [ 'a' ])) var b bool fmt . Println ( unsafe . Sizeof ( b )) var n int8 fmt . Println ( unsafe . Sizeof ( n )) var i interface {} fmt . Println ( unsafe . Sizeof ( i )) } An empty struct is 0, a boolean and an int8 are size 1 (byte), an interface is size 8 https://play.golang.org/p/9cUE9-wwDY https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Sizeof Polymorphism with Go Interfaces While definitely a distinctly different approach on objects and polymorphism than Object Oriented languages like Java and Python, the critical capabilities of Interfaces allows flexibility and re-usability in functionality enabling things like the Strategy Pattern. Starting with the fundamentals of Types and Structs, Interfaces are a natural extension to separating \"What\" behavior is desired versus \"How\" it is implemented. Using Interfaces can feel tricky at first but really the main challenge is the distinction between pointer receiver methods vs the default that Go has of pass by value (considering a pointer to be an integer value of an address ;) Also, testing in Go relies heavily on the developer paying that up front cost of creating Interfaces (which is a much better longer term modular abstraction) rather than using Mocks. This example uses a trivial Stack data structure but implements it 3 different ways to illustrate how the interface can have a variety of implementations and the caller can decide which one they prefer. package main import ( \"fmt\" ) // Stacker is a data structure that has specific data access and storage properties // also known as a Last In First Out queue, and not fully implemented for this example =] // This interfaces only requires two methods to implement type Stacker interface { Push ( n int ) Show () [] int } // DemoStack shows a demo example of different implementations of the interface func DemoStack ( s Stacker , name string ) { fmt . Println ( \"Pushing 2, 1, 0, onto\" , name ) s . Push ( 2 ) s . Push ( 1 ) s . Push ( 0 ) fmt . Println ( name , \"contains: \" , s . Show ()) } // FakeStack implements the interface using only value receivers type FakeStack struct { } var fakeStackCheater [] int // Show returns the global slice func ( s FakeStack ) Show () [] int { return fakeStackCheater } // Push uses a global variable (evil) so it can get away with a value method receiver func ( s FakeStack ) Push ( n int ) { fakeStackCheater = append ( fakeStackCheater , n ) } // SliceStack is an integer stack data structure built using a slice type SliceStack struct { s [] int } // Show displays the contents of the stack, pass a copy as no modification needed func ( s SliceStack ) Show () [] int { return s . s } // Push an integer onto the stack, pass a reference so the receiver method can directly modify // https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#receiver-type func ( s * SliceStack ) Push ( n int ) { s . s = append ( s . s , n ) } /* A real stack based upon a linked list */ // IntNode is a pointer data structure for holding an integer type IntNode struct { value int left * IntNode right * IntNode } // LinkedListStack is an integer stack data structure built using a slice type LinkedListStack struct { head * IntNode } // Show returns the total number of elements currently stored in the LinkedListStack func ( s LinkedListStack ) Show () [] int { var result [] int for current := s . head ; current != nil ; current = current . right { result = append ( result , current . value ) } return result } // Push an integer onto the stack, pass a reference so the receiver method can directly modify func ( s * LinkedListStack ) Push ( n int ) { new := IntNode { value : n } if s . head == nil { s . head = & new } else { new . right = s . head s . head = & new } } func main () { // a fake stack does not use pointer method receivers and must modify the data structure some other way var f FakeStack DemoStack ( f , \"FakeStack\" ) // stacks that modify their underlying data structure must pass a reference var s SliceStack DemoStack ( & s , \"SliceStack\" ) var k LinkedListStack DemoStack ( & k , \"LinkedListStack\" ) } This example contradicts one of the best practices: pointer receivers should be consistent https://tour.golang.org/methods/4 , so Show() and Push() should have the same receiver type A Pointer Receiver allows the method to make a modification (i.e. syntactic sugar where (s *SliceStack) Push(n int) could be thought of as Push(s *SliceStack, n int) A Pointer Receiver prevents an extra copy (in the instance of a very large object) All of the methods of an interface should be consistent (as a part of the developer user experience) References: https://play.golang.org/p/U1l2Ni89L4 play along with the source code snippet https://bitbucket.org/johnpfeiffer/go-interfaces-stack-linkedlist the more complete source code https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type) https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#interfaces https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#receiver-type https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern https://nathanleclaire.com/blog/2015/10/10/interfaces-and-composition-for-effective-unit-testing-in-golang/ https://blog.cloudflare.com/go-interfaces-make-test-stubbing-easy/ Doubly Linked List and First In First Out Queue With some small additions the linked list can be enhanced to provide the functionality of a Queue. The \"doubly linked list\" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list ) means that one can traverse from either the head (using next) or the tail (using previous). It is not too expensive to add the extra previous pointer to each node and a tail pointer and this makes the FIFO capabilities fairly straightforward. Thankfully with a garbage collected language like Go we do not have to worry about manually allocating or deallocating memory, though we should always keep an eye out for memory leaks package main import ( \"fmt\" ) // IntNode is a pointer data structure for holding an integer type IntNode struct { value int previous * IntNode next * IntNode } // MyList is a linked list of pointers type MyList struct { head * IntNode tail * IntNode } // Enqueue adds an integer onto the end of the list func ( q * MyList ) Enqueue ( n int ) { new := IntNode { value : n } if q . head == nil { q . head = & new q . tail = & new } else { q . tail . next = & new q . tail = & new } } // Dequeue removes the first integer added to the list (from the front) func ( q * MyList ) Dequeue () int { // TODO: error handling for dequeuing when the list is empty result := q . head q . head = q . head . next return result . value } func main () { var q MyList q .

Here are some tips I've found to make it easier: Layering: read through the material and just accept things without trying to understand every piece, small pieces are easier to digest and absorb Repetition: it is natural to read and re-read before comprehension occurs, learning right before sleep is scientifically proven to better enter long term memory Immersion: surround yourself with reminders of the material like books, web sites, on your phone, flash cards, online and real life discussions, videos Variety: sometimes it sticks better with a book, other times a video or podcast. Different teachers will emphasize or convey certain topics better. Do not give up because it's confusing from one source, there are many many sources to learn from Practice: apply yourself as programming is far better internalized \"in action\" rather than just theory Engage: using provided exercises will get you to the solution the instructor expects, creating your own coding projects will force you to use the tools in ways that make sense to you (and discover why certain things are \"best practice\") Go Deep: once comfortable moving around, real fluency and understanding requires digging into exactly how something is architected and implemented, what are the corner cases, and why things are done one way over another Arrays underlying slices with memory addresses and unsafe pointers Arrays are a mainstay of programming (mechanical sympathy for memory addresses and our very serial brains).

Gotcha with Slices and Pointers Assigning a new slice variable (pointer) to an existing slice will link the two together. This may lead to undesired \"side-effects\". package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main () { s := [] string { \"a\" , \"b\" , \"c\" } fmt .

Taking a different approach to my \"less than webscale\" personal web services has still made great improvements to the services and my quality of life. This article is categorized as Build and CI/CD and DevOps because while microservices is transformative for larger organizations to avoid the negative consequences of Conway's Law and provides a better architecture for really complex systems, in my case it was simply about decoupling deployments and not having all of my eggs in one basket. (e.g. the Drupal migration below actually did not affect the User Experience in any visible way). How to grow a monolith Value, value, value I've had a Virtual Private Server for many years and have been always able to find something for free (or as my requirements increased at most $10 a month). This has been at least 1000x worth the investment as it has provided a platform for learning and experimenting with all sorts of technology (Linux, PHP, Python, Twisted, MySQL, Redis, etc.) and of course a useful catch all tool (to check DNS resolution or temporarily store a file). I'm a firm believer in understanding the whole stack. Maintaining the OS and managing deployments has made me conscious of the many hidden costs and compromises/trade-offs in software and services. Organic Sprawl While I started with a personal notes site in PHP, I eventually added a couple of personal blogs using Drupal, and then another Drupal site about physics ( http://physicstime.com ) for my father in law, and then a few experiments in Python (including uwsgi and Twisted). This was all of course underpinned by the shared underlying Cherokee web server, Drupal, PHP, Python, MySQL, and Ubuntu. Physicstime alone has served over 500,000 visitors =) I envisioned that having a common platform would make it easier to add more sites and the shared maintenance meant I would only have to pay it once, especially considering the alternative of paying for and deploying many separate servers. I got to try a lot of different technologies but it started to be clear that it was not a \"common platform\" and maintenance (and just the mental energy of worrying about deferred maintenance) started to take up way too much time and effort. The downsides of a monolith Anecdotes: a security update meant the infrastructure provider needed to restart all of their host machines which meant \"hmmm, will all my services restart correctly on reboot?\" - luckily yes. Then I had to patch my virtual server (anything on the Internet is one vulnerability away from becoming taken over and in the least case being used for spam/DDoS and eventually being unable to actually serve my sites, in the worst case rooted or keystroke-logged in an attempt to hack my life or in a serious criminal pursuit). Oh and then there's the times the logs (web or auth due to anonymous attackers scanning) or backups filled the disk... (facepalm) Unavailability Due To: any infrastructure vendor maintenance any OS maintenance/upgrade incorrectly configured/rogue application a security issue in one affects them all they all contend for the same resources they all share the same version/dependency requiring upgrading and testing everything at once In Context: Linode, Ubuntu, Cherokee, and Drupal were good choices at the time Firstly let me say I picked a great vendor (Linode) who was very solid (they limit bad actor customers which tends to make resources predictable) and that Ubuntu OS and Cherokee webserver are very easy to setup and maintain which is one reason why I've put this off for so long. Drupal does an ok job of separating the tech stack from the content publishing so it was possible to ignore the tech side for awhile. Another factor is that iPhones/Android, Dropbox, Bitbucket/GitHub, PaaS, and a whole generation of technologies were not around when I set this up. Finally, maybe it's a corollary to Moore's law and the prevalence of the cloud but there's quite a bit of free compute around than there used to be =] Thinking Microservices Thinking about microservices is like TDD (Test Driven Design): it exposes assumptions, unmanaged organic evolution, and accidental complexity. Discovering the real problem domain When you have a hammer everything looks like a nail It becomes too easy to just use an interesting or popular technology for everything regardless of the true problem. Analyzing what I actually did with the various services I realized there were actually two distinct phases: creation and distribution. I did not have a \"realtime\" or \"high volume dynamic data\" use case, nor even a large number of content publishers that needed extra tooling. (The plugins/additions I used weren't even that exotic.) In contrast the overhead was my irreplaceable time spent for the maintenance of Ubuntu patching/upgrades, including the underlying PHP, Drupal upgrades, backups, and of course the inestimable risk of running something on the Internet. =p How I Converted to Microservices: Big Bang vs Kanban A common question is \"how\", and since \"it depends\" ;) in this case I had limited free hours to accomplish change and a strong desire to not break existing service. Rather than \"Big Bang\" I went Kanban https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development) (a much better analogy than Martin Fowler's \"strangler pattern\" analogy http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html ). This allowed gradual migration with the least disruption and the most flexibility in when changes would occur. As a not-to-be-underestimated bonus it was also the least stressful. Since I publish a post maybe once a month my blog was the simplest place to start. Feature parity requirements: publish read-only pages to the world editing some minimal data structure (category and tags) search preserve content and meta data regular backup of the content I migrated my content to a Pelican static site (with advanced functionality via a nice JavaScript theme) running on GitHub static pages and Travis CI. Having text in git provides a built in backup (published as html and stored remotely in markdown in the free \"Software as a Service\" repository) with of course a local git repo working copy on my laptop. The result is I only need to do a single git push of markdown text to deploy to production. It's highly available, scalable, and as a bonus there is versioning and I got a fairly snazzy facelift with improved search. Migration has extra costs of research and tweaks but is an opportunity for new benefits First I had to research and evaluate static site generators and static site hosts. Next I had to learn how to setup a workflow with test data to automate the process from writing content to publishing. The actual data migration was quite lengthy. This was due to the inevitable format change (export from Drupal to .md) and post transformation validation. Of course I also had to update DNS entries and even setup subdomains and 301 redirects. Like any rewrite I also ended up adding things (like tags). One of the most beneficial \"while I'm already redoing everything anyways\" enhancements was adding CDN and SSL via Cloudflare which actually added another layer of availability and security. Cloudflare also has very useful feature for blocking noise with Security -> Security Rules -> Create rule , to block \"Country is in RU, CN\" or \"AS Num is in 16276, 14061, 24940\" (OVH, DigitalOcean, Hetzner\" https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/ Data Gravity is expensive and Microservices allows polyglot so Go Programming My personal notes are full of years of research and was the most time consuming, fulfilling the adages of \"data gravity\" and \"unstructured data costs you\" =( A free static site on bitbucket.org (markdown in a free git repository transformed to html for free via Shippable.com) used the same pattern (and Pelican tech) as my blog: version control, offloading the hosting to someone else, and JavaScript for search. While the file system organically captures metadata like \"created date\" I had to inject that into the content; I found this to be a data integrity improvement as I had noticed before that FTP and git have a tendency to discard that metadata. One of the most time consuming transformations was just tweaking the plain text into markdown but this was worth the improvement in readability since the content is far more often read than written =] While Markdown violates the principle of separating data and presentation I found it to be a pragmatic compromise as it IS a standard and it's machine readable. (I could theoretically use a script to convert it back to plaintext ;) Oh right, so Go, aka Golang? I leveraged Google AppEngine and for fun got to use the relatively new programming language Go to write a custom 301 redirector to prevent links on the Internet from breaking and allow search engines link from all of the previous URLs to the new locations. While Python is very easy to pickup I found Go to be similar enough (especially to C) to be also not so hard to learn (lots of documentation!) and better able to do what I needed simply within the language (though Python pretty much has a library for everything it also has C dependencies that don't always play nice with a PlatformAsAService). Drupal to Drupal The more things change the more they stay the same. Wherever you go there you are. The most active Drupal site will stay Drupal on DigitalOcean (to leverage their one click example) and cheaper prices. Edit: one click was for Drupal8, yet another headache migration, so not in the scope of this project. Now at least as an isolated service (website) on a dedicated server, updates will be specific to it. I also put in the effort to use automation via Packer and experiment with Docker... Immutable Packer I considered Docker Machine and Ansible but both seemed the wrong tools for my purpose. Docker Machine is still relatively new and is more oriented towards a cluster of nodes. Additionally the post docker image phase (ssh commands to install things) seems overly complex. Ansible (SSH paradigm) is simpler than chef but encourages a mutable long lived server. Packer has a simple and straight forward way of building an immutable server image for DigitalOcean yet retains the flexibility to adapt to other cloud vendors later if needed. Drupal website context and domain problems Besides the basic components (Docker will simplify this): nginx, php, MySQL The ongoing issues: Backups of the MySQL and uploaded files Upgrades of the OS and components (security) Upgrades (security) of Drupal and modules Hint: DigitalOcean offer full disk image backups as a paid service so if I ever stop being cheap this resolves pretty quickly The full details are in a separate post but I'm pretty happy that setting up the box from scratch again, upgrading the various subcomponents, or even migrating to a different vendor will be a lot easier in the future (and won't affect any of the other projects I have going on). Why not just automate the monolith The \"easy\" answer may have been to automate more of my \"ball of mud\" to address the effort/efficiency of applying security updates. Yet the \"better monolith\" would mean I still owned the maintenance and uptime for a large percent of my services. The microservices approach of diversity means that with different providers (GitHub, Bitbucket, Google AppEngine, DigitalOcean, etc.) it is nearly impossible for them to all go down simultaneously or be affected by one another. Leveraging other platforms that better fit my use case means I benefit from their expertise and by reducing the moving parts I have a reduced security risk. My experiments in other frameworks and programming languages were never a good match for my \"production\" web services. \"because it's there\" or \"because I can\" are very often the reason things continue to be done in a suboptimal way ;) Now I will focus more on the \"top\" of the tech stack and high value content (like this blog post), less on the \"how to automate and deploy\" portion. Ongoing and Future Work I still have to purchase/renew domains, update DNS, and write content. I still have to eventually find a platform that allows my father-in-law to publish content (and upload files) where I'm not responsible for security patches or backups ;) My experimenting is now done via a PaaS like Google AppEngine, Heroku, Openshift etc. or using Docker containers. That means more admin and cognitive sprawl but PaaS and CaaS are more predisposed to version control and elastic/disposable architecture so in all a lot less maintenance. The biggest new cost is managing the increased number of services but this at least makes explicit what I am working on and is mostly mitigated by automation.","tags":"build-CI-CD-devops","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/a-micro-story-about-migrating-a-personal-monolith-into-microservices/"},{"title":"Drupal with Docker Compose and nginx and php-fpm and mariadb","text":"Replacing: cherokee webserver, php-cgi, MySQL In my professional life I've seen the webserver front end default choice shift from Apache to NGINX occur for production services. Nginx is compelling due to simpler configuration and improved performance so I suspect the existing preponderance of Apache deployments are because \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" (which makes lots of sense in Operations) along with the large number of Ops/SysAdmins who already know how to configure and integrate Apache (which makes a lot of sense to Management). https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-vs-apache-our-view/ For a personal project I experimented with and chose Cherokee web server ( http://cherokee-project.com/ ) because it offered good performance and a simpler setup (Web UI even!) Unfortunately as the project Dev and adoption slowed it seemed to make a lot of sense to finally convert my personal project to nginx. https://github.com/cherokee/webserver/commits/master I also wanted to experiment with a Docker based infrastructure (with docker-compose and a single YAML config file, ideally leveraging as much as possible the many official upstream docker images ( https://hub.docker.com/explore/ )) Benefits: this would isolate my app from the Host OS (increased portability) allow for simpler component swapping or upgrades (with testing and rollback and even local Dev) leave room for adding other isolated components Almost able to leverage everything right out of the box I spent time researching nginx and php-fpm and created a minimal config that worked (two docker commands) based on the slimmer alpine linux docker images. https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/nginx-with-docker/ This wasn't quite far off from the official Drupal Dockerfile except there are some more OS dependencies like GD and XML so I instead opted to use the official Drupal Docker image. (Non alpine linux so larger size but they've done the work of packaging the complexity and by not customizing it will be easier to update in the future - and avoid a Docker Build entirely!) docker-compose.yml for nginx and drupal:7-fpm and mariadb:5.5 # https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/ # https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/ # https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/recipes/drupal nginx : image : nginx : alpine ports : - \"80:80\" volumes : - ./ nginx . conf : / etc / nginx / nginx . conf : ro - ./ default . conf : / etc / nginx / conf . d / default . conf : ro - / var / www / html : / var / www / html / links : - fpm # https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal/ fpm : image : drupal : 7 - fpm ports : - \"9000:9000\" volumes : - / var / www / html : / var / www / html / links : - mysql # https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/ mysql : image : mariadb : 5.5 ports : - \"3306:3306\" environment : - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD - MYSQL_USER - MYSQL_PASSWORD - MYSQL_DATABASE Adding the MariaDB (compatible with MySQL) image/container was fairly straightforward (just reading the docs on how to override and setup the default user and DB via Environment Variables) I am ok with the Database files being kept completely inside of a persistent container. I expect to do regular backups (mysqldump and scp) and may also spend the money to just use DigitalOcean's backup service (no poweroff required!) And the bugs I discovered a bug where the css/themes didn't render correctly. As part of the troubleshooting I installed nginx, php, and MySQL locally on the host with my override configs (no bug exhibited). I then replaced each \"native host installed service\" with the Docker one, working from the backend DB forward I was able to identify the issue. Unfortunately the nginx image uses a default user of \"nginx\" whereas the drupal:php image uses \"www-data\" which caused issues when accessing the Drupal source files (which I was sharing via --volume on the host, preferring to eschew a \"data container\"). My personal Linux maxim still holds true: \"If there's a problem with something running in Linux it's probably a Permissions issue\". ;) Do not add complexity I avoided creating my own docker image build FROM drupal:php with nginx included because: simplest with as few build steps possible contrary to the \"do one thing well\" principle contrary to the \"one container one app\" Docker principle tight coupling of nginx and php would make it harder to update one or the other independently Cache your upstream dependencies Ironically I also ended up providing my own drupal.tar.gz downloaded from Drupal.org but cached in Bitbucket as the upstream ftp.drupal.org proved unreliable. The pragmatic solution Instead, as I was already using packer on DigitalOcean to automate building the Host and uploading the custom configs, docker-compose.yaml, and Drupal source, I added a few steps to install nginx directly to the Host OS. packer.json NEWUSER_NAME=username NEWUSER_PASSWORD=yourpassword DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN=yourapitoken /opt/packer build packer.json A few files and a single command (packer is just a single binary downloaded from hashicorp) I can have another Docker based Drupal host ready (awyeah) { \"_comment\" : \"https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/digitalocean.html\" , \"variables\" : { \"digitalocean_api_token\" : \"{{env `DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN`}}\" , \"newuser_name\" : \"{{env `NEWUSER_NAME`}}\" , \"newuser_password\" : \"{{env `NEWUSER_PASSWORD`}}\" } , \"builders\" : [{ \"type\" : \"digitalocean\" , \"api_token\" : \"{{user `digitalocean_api_token`}}\" , \"size\" : \"512mb\" , \"region\" : \"lon1\" , \"image\" : \"ubuntu-16-04-x64\" , \"droplet_name\" : \"drupal-from-packer-{{timestamp}}\" , \"snapshot_name\" : \"drupal-from-packer-{{isotime \\\" 2006.01.02.030405 \\\" }}\" }] , \"provisioners\" : [ { \"type\" : \"shell\" , \"inline\" : [ \"ip a\" , \"curl -s http://checkip.amazonaws.com\" , \"apt-get update\" , \"sudo apt-get install -y vim curl wget byobu ntp tar gzip\" , \"timedatectl set-timezone Etc/UTC\" , \"cat /etc/timezone\" , \"date\" , \"useradd -s /bin/bash -m {{user `newuser_name`}}\" , \"usermod -a -G admin {{user `newuser_name`}}\" , \"echo '{{user `newuser_name`}}:{{user `newuser_password`}}'|chpasswd\" , \"cat /etc/passwd\" , \"sed -i 's/Port 22/Port 2222/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"echo 'PasswordAuthentication no' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"mkdir -p /home/{{user `newuser_name`}}/.ssh\" , \"fallocate -l 1G /swapfile\" , \"chmod 600 /swapfile\" , \"mkswap /swapfile\" , \"swapon /swapfile\" , \"swapon --show\" , \"free -h\" , \"echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\" , \"echo 'vm.swappiness=10' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\" , \"echo 'vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\" ] } , { \"type\" : \"file\" , \"source\" : \"authorized_keys\" , \"destination\" : \"/home/{{user `newuser_name`}}/.ssh/authorized_keys\" } , { \"type\" : \"shell\" , \"script\" : \"install-docker.sh\" } , { \"type\" : \"file\" , \"source\" : \"docker-compose.yml\" , \"destination\" : \"/home/{{user `newuser_name`}}/docker-compose.yml\" } , { \"type\" : \"shell\" , \"inline\" : [ \"mkdir -p /var/www/html\" , \"wget https://bitbucket.org/yourusername/yourrepository/raw/97360be2edd53b93149d750db24f749aebc27988/binaries/drupal-7.50.tar.gz\" , \"tar xf drupal-7.50.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C /var/www/html\" , \"ls -ahl /var/www/html\" , \"mkdir -p /var/www/html/sites/default/files\" , \"chmod 777 /var/www/html/sites/default/files\" , \"cp -a /var/www/html/sites/default/default.settings.php /var/www/html/sites/default/settings.php\" , \"chmod 777 /var/www/html/sites/default/settings.php\" ] } , { \"type\" : \"shell\" , \"inline\" : [ \"apt-get install -y nginx\" ] } , { \"type\" : \"file\" , \"source\" : \"nginx.conf\" , \"destination\" : \"/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\" } , { \"type\" : \"file\" , \"source\" : \"default.conf\" , \"destination\" : \"/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf\" } ] } HINT: A DigitalOcean 512MB droplet needs swap enabled due to the MySQL/MariaDB memory defaults, otherwise you get strange errors about inode unavailable while starting the MariaDB container https://www.suse.com/documentation/opensuse114/book_tuning/data/cha_tuning_memory_vm.html https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.7/2.6.7-mm1/broken-out/vfs-shrinkage-tuning.patch One thing that is annoying is as a single partition it is potentially vulnerable to a /var/log DenialOfService A very nice tool to add is fail2ban (apt-get install fail2ban) but I want to ensure I tweak the configs correctly install-docker.sh #!/bin/sh # ubuntu 16.04 is xenial , https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/docker-intro-install-run-and-port-forward/ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D sudo sh -c \"echo 'deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list\" sudo apt-get update || exit 1 sudo apt-get install -y linux-image-extra- $( uname -r ) || exit 1 sudo apt-get install -y docker-engine docker-compose || exit 1 service docker status || exit 1 docker info || exit 1 linux-image-extra is to ensure we have AUFS because docker needs a proper storage driver An alternative is to download the docker-compose binary directly (to /usr/local/bin): -

And for this migration project a MySQL dump, SCP of the existing extra modules, and of course the already uploaded user images/files. I'm sure with more tinkering I can overcome the nginx vs www-data user permissions issue but since I time boxed this project I stuck with this compromise which is still much more improved and automated than my previous setup.

(Though this might also be due to the cheaper node price) The other major advantage of using docker is that different components/services can be upgraded independently (and even just \"test upgraded\") which allows for a faster adoption of upstream project improvements. I personally don't like relying on the OS of the host for all of the global dependencies to play nice (and especially that different packages won't have conflicting dependencies). Since all of these processes are running in the same host that I own I expect I'm not worse off security wise. I'm curious to see if given enough time I run into the infamous /var/lib/docker issues of orphan containers, running out of disk space, or other issues. A next step might be to run this in a PlatormAsAService like OpenShift or better yet break up each container to run via a ContainerAsAService (if it's free ;) Obviously if performance and scale of a mostly read-only content distribution system was really an issue adding a cache layer like Varnish or Cloudflare or even just tweaking the various configurations would help =]","tags":"virtualization","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/drupal-with-docker-compose-and-nginx-and-php-fpm-and-mariadb/"},{"title":"Alpine Linux Introduction Tutorial","text":"Alpine Linux is a minimalist secure linux distro.

A debian package is a way to distribute and install a collection of files (aka software) onto a system (i.e. Debian or Ubuntu). While a piece of software might depend on other debian packages (e.g. libraries) usually a single .deb file represents some sort of module that serves a single purpose. Once a debian package is built any client (dpkg or apt which also uses dpkg ;) can use it to install the software. https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html Why use a Debian Package? When you're developing on your own box you can pretty much get away with anything A complex and large scale production environment typically has a lot of costs (both operationally and in not becoming a bottleneck to dev velocity). Any opportunity to increase determinism and reduce risk is welcome. Deploying source code directly from version control does not always scale well (streaming tons of small files, dedicated read only service user direct to production, etc.) nor does it create enough determinism with regards to dependency management. As deployments become more frequent and Continuous Integration becomes more complex it is really important to embrace the \"build once\" principle so that a single artifact (hopefully with all of its dependencies) can pass through the gauntlet of integration testing and canary/incremental rollout. So now that you're convinced \"Artifacts\" are the way to go lets just skip .exe, .msi, .jar, .etc and go straight to... The Debian Package is a \"battle tested\" format with lots of features (dependency requirements, preinst scripts, postinst scripts, etc.) but if there is a bug in a specific .deb file it is not always practical to get the full source code and rebuild the whole thing (especially considering static bindings and specific compilation environment/parameters). One example people give is an erroneous pre install or post install script that is preventing either installation or removal.

As soon as you have conflicting version requirements this breaks. As soon as you have multiple applications/services installing globally it becomes unmanageable. Virtualenv creates a virtual environment (basically injecting a PATH into the environment) for python binaries and package installation. Pinning Versions and Guaranteed Sourcing One common mistake is to not pin version numbers and depend on https://pypi.python.org Without pinning version numbers for your dependencies (listed one per line in requirements.txt) you will receive a nasty surprise when the maintainers make a breaking change and you get a newer version unexpectedly. Since python is a dynamic language you may receive the worst kind of surprise in production (hopefully nothing as bad as data corruption or security issues). When you do pin the version number BUT still depend on https://pypi.python.org to provide the file then the project maintainers may remove the version you are pinned to (causing your builds to fail - though some for some cowboys this will cause production deployments to fail). Pin the version of your dependencies, provide the dependencies locally or through a system under your control (your own pypi server or s3 bucket) , explicit is better than implicit. Wheels are better Python Packaging Wheels are (awesome), it's the beginning of trying to make python installations more deterministic and pip less dynamic at install time. http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ An output directory of the wheels of a project are known by convention as a \"wheelhouse\". As a side effect the wheel directory, \"/tmp/wheelhouse\" in the example, contains installable copies of the exact versions of your application's dependencies. By installing from those cached wheels you can recreate that environment quickly and with no surprises. When you install using pip it looks for a \"wheel file\" (*.whl which is the newer zip compressed format, goodbye .egg) of the correct name for your (virtual) environment (e.g. py2 or py3 or x86 linux). This wheel file saves time and bugs from installing a package/.egg from source (usually that time is spent compiling C code for the python library). sudo pip install wheel cd projectsource python setup.py bdist_wheel ls -l ./dist pip wheel --find-links /root/wheelhouse --wheel-dir = /root/wheelhouse -r requirements.txt https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_wheel/ http://pip-python3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel.html#build-system-interface installing using a wheel file pip install somepackage - version - py2 . py3 . whl pip freeze error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel' https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils#downloads only provided a py3 wheel (facepalm) Downloading the source .tar.gz and running python setup.py bdist_wheel resulted in: error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel' Reading the internet provided no comprehensible answers (lots of \"setuptools does not match your version of pip or wheel or whatever\") The following hacking seems to have provided a solution: :::bash python --version pip --version cd /tmp wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/docutils/docutils-0.12.tar.gz#md5=4622263b62c5c771c03502afa3157768 tar xf docutils-0.12.tar.gz cd docutils-0.12 virtualenv venv source venv/bin/activate python --version pip --version pip install wheel pip freeze python setup.py install pip freeze pip wheel . ls /tmp/docutils-0.12/wheelhouse docutils-0.12-py2-none-any.whl","tags":"build-CI-CD-devops","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/python-packaging-pip-wheels/"},{"title":"Static site with Bitbucket and Shippable and Pelican","text":"Running Software Costs Money One of the most overlooked costs in running a service is operations. While Research and Development (aka coding) is often cited as the largest expense (software developer salaries! https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-average-operating-costs-of-SaaS-companies ), and 80% (or more) of (successful) software's life is maintenance ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3610582/ ), you have to run the darn thing all the time. A Free and Efficient Static Web Site What is one cost effective (free!) and efficient solution to running a static site? Bitbucket also has a free static site capability (as long as the DNS is USERNAME.bitbucket.org), so no server/hosting required Bitbucket have free private repositories The Bitbucket static site repository can be private (only the html exposed will be visible to anonymous users) Shippable have a free plan with 1 container that will do your builds (fine by me, Docker is fast!) Pelican converts markdown into .html and you can still use javascript for fancy things http://docs.getpelican.com/ Sadly it looks like the Shippable startup is having trouble maintaining/updating their Docker images so I recommend instead to use Bitbucket Pipelines https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/continuous-delivery-with-bitbucket-pipelines-and-google-app-engine-deployment-and-the-storageobjectslist-error/#bitbucket-pipelines-configuration The basic process is to be triggered by a git push to the private repository of new/updated source markdown, use pelican to process it into .html, and then publish (git push) the new/updated .html to the static site repository. One reason to use two seperate repositories instead of only one repository is that if you make a commit to your markdown source repository that will trigger a CI run which will push the updated .html files to the repository which would be detected and maybe trigger an infinite loop. Or at the least interleave your source code changes with generated output changes in the commit logs. =] An alternative is using multiple branches but you'd better hope nobody ever deletes your source branch by accident. Another alternative is to include an IF statement in your shippable code to not push if the diff/md5 of the source files (or maybe check against the output .html?) still match. I say keep it super simple ;) Bitbucket setup Create The Source and Target Repositories Create a new private repository (for your markdown), consider prefixing the name with source or something (good names makes for good maintenance) Make sure you have cloned the pelican project and setup a basic static site: https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/how-to-set-up-a-pelican-static-blog-site/ Inside your .gitignore you will probably want to exclude .pyc and ./output and any other pelican created artifacts. Inside your repository at the root level you will need a shippable.yaml file: language : python python : - \"2.7\" install : - pip install pelican Markdown beautifulsoup4 script : - rm - rf ./ output - rm - rf ./ cache - rm - rf ./ plugins /* - mv ./ pelican - project /* . - ls - ahl ./ content - pelican ./ content - o ./ output - s ./ publishconf . py after_script : - ls - ahl - ls - ahl ./ output This assumes that the pelican-project is a subdirectory in the repository using the best practice of leaving the top level of a repository for build and test artifacts and isolating the source code into a subdirectory. Create another private repository for your public html. It MUST be named USERNAME.bitbucket.org to make use of the bitbucket static site capabilities. (yes, the name must include those dots/domain name of the service) https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html Get OAuth Access The goal here is to leverage the one-hour-access-token-generation-via-Oauth in order to write to a different repository in Bitbucket. Generate a Consumer OAuth2 Token with https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html#OAuthonBitbucketCloud-Createaconsumer (The UI in https://bitbucket.org/account/user/USERNAME/api is fairly straightforward with \"Add consumer\") The least privilege required permissions would be \"Repositories: Read, Write\" You must define a callback URL, i.e. http://YOURDOMAIN:8888 , even if it is not used by this workaround Use curl to verify your token (this is how Shippable will get a 1 hour expiring access token to work on the target output repository) curl https : //bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -d grant_type=client_credentials -u yourkeyhere:yoursecrethere { \"access_token\" : \"abcd1234...\" , \"scopes\" : \"repository:write\" , \"expires_in\" : 3600 , ... } The curl command should get a JSON response which includes an access_token http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24965307/how-to-manipulate-bitbucket-repository-with-token Shippable setup Sadly it looks like the Shippable startup is having trouble maintaining/updating their Docker images so I recommend instead to use Bitbucket Pipelines https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/continuous-delivery-with-bitbucket-pipelines-and-google-app-engine-deployment-and-the-storageobjectslist-error/#bitbucket-pipelines-configuration Enable the integration with Bitbucket: http://docs.shippable.com/#step-0-prerequisite Right from the beginning Shippable tries to ask which source repository provider (either GitHub or Bitbucket) you will be using.

Software has always been about automation and leveraging the computer's capacity for precision and repetition. Somehow though, software is sometimes still deployed using a series of often poorly documented steps (to physical hardware even!). I've been there, it ain't pretty. (badpokerface) The second time you need to build a server running service(s) you may be under time pressure. (Murphy's law says you might be building it again because the first one which was business critical blew up unexpectedly.) Building things by hand is possibly the most expensive way to generate impossible to reproduce bugs and job security for the personality challenged. (Almost everyone agrees that technology employees are expensive and so by extension their time is constantly being wasted by everything they do). As virtualization (and linux!) took over the world there was an explosion of virtual machines that needed to be deployed and an evolution of a fairly standard virtual harwdare layer. (x86 cpu and Intel NIC anyone?) Suddenly you couldn't hire enough antisocial people to run around with floppies and scratching cds while shoving them into servers. Why not chef? Chef, Puppet, and Ansible are the well known configuration management and build/deployment automation tools. Automated configuration management which tries to keep a remote server in a specific state seems like a good recipe for things going wrong I've used chef successfully quite a few times and the main things that make it a specialized tool that I prefer not to use: It's really easy to do chef wrong: nested roles and recipes that keep exploding exponentially with circular dependencies which make you think software development starts looking easy again. Community cookbooks are written to allow deployment on every architecture ever created (Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Windows, SPARC, etc.) which makes them challenging to read and debug, almost impossible to customize to do what you actually want. The ruby based DSL isn't bad but it's pretty annoying to constantly make syntax errors (which unless you're all TDD rambo and use Kitchen you'll find during the never ending waiting many minutes for a deployment to fail) It's difficult to debug the non intuitive \"compilation phase\" and \"execution phase\" way chef does its dependency tree magic, and the \"shoot yourself in the foot\" is compounded with the apparently edge case necessary compile time run executions The \"best practices\" have changed 3 or 4 times (write your own custom cookbooks, leverage the community cookbooks, write a custom wrapper for the community cookbook, don't ever use set_unless even though it still exists, etc.) and the 6 layers of variable overrides makes it hard to keep track of what the actual output of a script will be (don't worry, they have pages of documentation explaining it) The recommended \"chef client server architecture\" does not scale to really large numbers well and creates administration overhead and a lot of authorization complexity - and my preferred method with \"chef solo\" still requires an annoying amount of bootstrap setup on the target machines. Polling not only creates network congestion but worse creates windows of uncertainty about deployment state and the possibility of nodes silently dropping out https://docs.chef.io/chef_client.html Chef tends to encourage the pattern of long lived mutable servers (with their therefore necessary expensive and obnoxious biological caretakers) https://docs.chef.io/resource_common.html#lazy-evaluation https://docs.chef.io/resource_common.html#run-in-compile-phase http://erik.hollensbe.org/2013/03/16/the-chef-resource-run-queue/ So is there a simpler way to just reliably, reproducibly, build a box? Packer to the rescue Packer is from the same people who brought you Vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/ , that really easy way to set up a virtual machine... https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/using-vagrant-to-deploy-instances-on-aws It is very straightforward to read and actually you can still leverage chef (unless you realize that a series of shell commands is all you wanted anyways...) This leads to the better path of \"immutable servers\" http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ImmutableServer.html packer --version my_example_box.json { \"variables\" : { \"aws_access_key\" : \"\" , \"aws_secret_key\" : \"\" }, \"builders\" : [{ \"type\" : \"amazon-ebs\" , \"access_key\" : \"{{user `aws_access_key`}}\" , \"secret_key\" : \"{{user `aws_secret_key`}}\" , \"region\" : \"us-east-1\" , \"source_ami\" : \"ami-de0d9eb7\" , \"instance_type\" : \"t1.micro\" , \"ssh_username\" : \"ubuntu\" , \"ami_name\" : \"packer-example {{timestamp}}\" }] } packer validate mybox.json packer build mybox.json packer build -debug mybox.json This will prompt for the enter key to continue at each step Once it's done it will terminate the EC2 instance for you (it only runs as long as it takes to build the machine and then burn the Amazon Machine Image). us-east-1: ami-19601234 Unfortunately it is not machine readable json output so you have to do some bash-fu to extract just the id Also unfortunately there is no way to tell packer to not terminate so you can troubleshoot, the workarounds are the -debug which is essentially \"interactive\" or adding sleep commands my_advanced_box.json { \"_comment\" : \"This is a comment\" , \"variables\" : { \"my_secret\" : \"{{env `MY_SECRET`}}\" , }, \"builders\" : [{ \"type\" : \"amazon-ebs\" , \"region\" : \"us-east-1\" , \"source_ami\" : \"ami-de0d9eb7\" , \"instance_type\" : \"t1.micro\" , \"ssh_username\" : \"ubuntu\" , \"ami_name\" : \"packer-example {{timestamp}}\" \"subnet_id\" : \"subnet-f0be1234\" , \"security_group_id\" : \"sg-9bf51234\" , \"associate_public_ip_address\" : true , \"ssh_keypair_name\" : \"my-packer\" , \"ssh_private_key_file\" : \"./my-packer.pem\" }], \"provisioners\" : [{ \"type\" : \"file\" , \"source\" : \"./debs/\" , \"destination\" : \"/tmp\" }, { \"type\" : \"shell\" , \"inline\" : [ \"/sbin/ip a\" , \"curl -s http://checkip.amazonaws.com\" , \"ls -ahl /tmp\" , \"echo {{user `my_secret`}} > /tmp/{{isotime \\\"2006-01-02-030405\\\"}}--my-secret.txt\" , \"sudo dpkg -i --force-confnew /tmp/*.deb\" , \"machine_state_validation.sh\" ] }] } The access credentials could instead be environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY Post instantiation validation is a really handy safeguard as statistically something always goes wrong somewhere and it's far cheaper to find out with a quick test versus a system that loses data. Packer and DigitalOcean DigitalOcean is a relatively new player (compared to Linode and even AWS) but they provide a very fast and easy to use way of building boxes (a snapshot can be used like an AMI to spin up multiple instances). { \"_comment\" : \"https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/digitalocean.html\" , \"variables\" : { \"digitalocean_api_token\" : \"{{env `DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN`}}\" , \"newuser_name\" : \"{{env `NEWUSER_NAME`}}\" , \"newuser_password\" : \"{{env `NEWUSER_PASSWORD`}}\" } , \"builders\" : [{ \"type\" : \"digitalocean\" , \"api_token\" : \"{{user `digitalocean_api_token`}}\" , \"size\" : \"512mb\" , \"region\" : \"lon1\" , \"image\" : \"ubuntu-16-04-x64\" , \"droplet_name\" : \"built-from-packer-{{timestamp}}\" , \"snapshot_name\" : \"built-from-packer-{{timestamp}}\" }] , \"provisioners\" : [ { \"type\" : \"shell\" , \"inline\" : [ \"ip a\" , \"curl -s http://checkip.amazonaws.com\" , \"apt-get update\" , \"sudo apt-get install -y vim curl wget byobu ntp\" , \"timedatectl set-timezone Etc/UTC\" , \"cat /etc/timezone\" , \"date\" , \"useradd -s /bin/bash -m {{user `newuser_name`}}\" , \"usermod -a -G admin {{user `newuser_name`}}\" , \"echo '{{user `newuser_name`}}:{{user `newuser_password`}}'|chpasswd\" , \"cat /etc/passwd\" , \"sed -i 's/Port 22/Port 2222/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"echo 'PasswordAuthentication no' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config\" , \"mkdir -p /home/{{user `newuser_name`}}/.ssh\" , \"mkdir -p /opt/www/html\" ] } , { \"type\" : \"file\" , \"source\" : \"authorized_keys\" , \"destination\" : \"/home/{{user `newuser_name`}}/.ssh/authorized_keys\" } ] } This is a simple example that automates some of the security best practices of a non standard username, non standard ssh port, no ssh root login, no ssh password based login, etc. NEWUSER_NAME=yourusername NEWUSER_PASSWORD=yourpassword DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN=012345yourtoken /opt/packer build packer.json Why not docker containers?

worker_processes 2;\" from https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/commandline/ nginx.conf While there are quite a few ways to configure nginx one choice to make with Docker is to either docker run --name some-nginx -v /some/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro -d nginx run docker as a daemon with a specified Container Name and override the container nginx.conf file with /some/nginx.conf from the hose Use a Dockerfile (based on the upstream nginx Docker image) to copy your own configuration file and other custom bits in and build your own custom Docker image (a highly recommended way of not being completely dependent on an upstream provider - especially if you push your Docker Image to your own private registry afterwards) e.g. https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/~/dockerfile/ which also has \"Foreman in Go lang\" and makes use of expecting the Host to provide the SSL certificates https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/nginx-web-server/ https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/ Quickly testing the nginx configuration file using an ephemeral docker container: docker run --rm --publish 127 .0.0.1:80:80 nginx /bin/bash -c \"nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\" nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful Build your own nginx Dockerfile If you require 3rd party modules then you will have to build nginx from source, e.g. https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module#installation That being the case you'll probably want to have a build process with 2 Docker files: the first Dockerfile will contain build-essentials, gcc, make, etc. so that you can build the binary from source (with any 3rd party modules) http://nginx.org/en/docs/configure.html The second docker image would be your \"production container\" where you copy in the custom nginx binary, install the dependencies (i.e. openssl), and setup the default config. Converting an existing nginx 3rd party module to a dynamic module Since NGINX 1.9.11 supports dynamic modules and attempts to maintain API compatibility then it is possible to sometimes convert a module into a dynamic module (i.e. build the shared library object) ./configure --add-dynamic-module=/opt/source/ngx_my_module/ make -f objs/Makefile modules Look for .so files in the objs directory after compilation or the modules subdirectory during installation https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/extending/converting/ Configuring nginx There are entire books about how to configure nginx so I will just jot down some basics for myself. /etc/nginx/nginx.conf user nginx ; worker_processes 4 ; pid / run / nginx . pid ; events { worker_connections 1024 ; } http { server { location / { root / var / www ; } } # include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf; } Run the service as the www-data user and define 4 worker processes define an HTTP server that listens on port 80 by default the root location will return the contents of /var/www a best practice is to use multiple configuration files in the conf.d directory (as a really long complex configuration in a single is difficult to maintain) BUT we must comment it out as in the installation there can be a default.conf that overrides our nginx.conf sudo docker run -it --rm --publish 0.0.0.0:80:80 --volume /tmp/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro nginx:alpine /bin/sh debug the image interactively by overriding the default CMD with a shell (remember that Alpine is limited so apk update and apk add SOMENAME sudo docker run --rm --publish 0.0.0.0:80:80 --volume /tmp/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro nginx:alpine /bin/sh -c \"nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\" alternative method to just test your configuration file sudo docker run -- rm -- publish 0.0 . 0.0 : 80 : 80 -- volume / tmp / nginx . conf : / etc / nginx / nginx . conf : ro -- volume / tmp / www : / var / www : ro nginx : alpine assumes you have a config file and some index file defined echo \" <html><body> hi </body></html> \" > /var/www/index.html That's it, now you have nginx serving static files!

Today I had the opportunity to meet Bjarne Stroustrup http://www.stroustrup.com/ , creator of C++. (yey) To put this in perspective, C++ is one of the most popular programming languages of all time and is essentially like meeting the inventor of the hammer. (mindblown) To summarize, he was one of the most intelligent, mindful, humble, and quietly passionate people I have ever met. Truly an inspiration to any engineer. I have taken a tiny amount of free license due to my faulty memory and for readability. Getting the book signed I had dug out my old The C++ Programming Language (3rd edition from 1997) which filled me with nostalgia of how amazing it was to read a text book that was just full of succinct coding amazingness. So many textbooks were full of fluff, confusion, and downright goofiness but that book opened my mind to the difference it makes to have the original inventor writing it (Kernighan and Ritchie ;) Lucky me, I was there about 15 minutes early and while they got the Audio/Video set up I bravely politely asked him to sign it. (yes, success!) There was one other co worker there who was helping him prepare (and apparently also a huge fan, I took her picture with him) and I managed to ask some small talk questions (go me!) Bjarne seemed distant at first and his driver/handler (former Chief Technology Officer somewhere important) was maybe a bit apprehensive but I suspect the fan-ness of it all relaxed a bit after we proved we weren't pyschos... \"This book was really amazing.\" He responded, \"Well this one is a bit old, you should use a newer edition\". I quickly replied, \"I don't actually use this in my day to day work so I keep it at home. It's a bit heavy to carry around all the time, I read a lot of things on my phone (easier to get the latest version of the books).\" I must have hit a topic of interest for him as he came over and I had flipped open the book to some sample code. He ruminated, \"Well, actually, I prefer this kind of reading with a book. The formatting and print... you have to work hard to make sure the examples don't get split across pages. And you have two pages.\" (Gesturing with his hands the extra width) I agreed with him, \"Yes, it is certainly a lot easier to read the diagrams and code examples in a physical book. The phone screen is really small. I guess the book is a perfected technology that's been around 1000 years.\" \"You know Atlassian isn't really a C++ shop, more Java with some Javascript... and Python products teams here in SF. Actually it's even a really argumentative culture sometimes around technology, though with you here I'm sure they'll all be quiet and respectful.\" He actually smiled at that, \"Back in AT&T we would ask: was there blood on the floor? That was how serious the discussions got. Not really any blood on the floor, just an expression.\" \"What do you enjoy most from your travels/touring?\" Such a wise response: \"Meeting the people, learning about what they're thinking and what new ideas they might have\". Looking around the mostly empty room with 1 minute before the event starts, \"Well I don't know where everyone else is, I'm sure there's lots of interest but the SF office is the Marketing and Business headquarters with only a few Development/Product teams\". He responded, \"Yesterday Facebook was standing room only.\" I looked over at the monitors, \"Well I'm sure there'll be attendance from the other offices too\". \"What other locations does Atlassian have?\" \"Austin, and of course Sydney has 800 Java Developers, and Poland, and Vietnam, it's a pretty globally diverse company\". I also warned him about the air conditioning intermittently coming on and being loud and often too cold. \"I was baking hot yesterday so I guess if it's cold in here today I guess it will average out\". (With his curious funny little smile) And with the microphone on and an international audience he was introduced and here were the questions and answers... Current challenges for programming languages Since hardware improvements are through parallelization (unless quantum entanglements gets solved soon) developers must adapt, but concurrency is hard. (And no global variables, right?) \"Functional programming has good ideas but I did not want everything to be a recursive function\" Distributed systems are a new perspective problem: for a fair trade, an exchange in New York offering the same price to Sydney and San Francisco becomes difficult (the speed of light is still a limit). Anyone heard of the leap second? There are at least 3 ways it is being dealt with: Hold on for a really long time and then jump forward all at once. Jump forward immediately. Break the leap second into a lot of intervals and merge it in. But if it's a distributed system how can everyone agree? And that's just one example. Trends in programming? Silicon Valley is an echo chamber but you probably know more than I do. Mobile is very hot but it is a very small screen, and not everything (like a textbook) can be read on a small phone screen or even a tablet screen. A second favorite language? Bjarne was incredibly diplomatic about pointing out that any language he said he preferred might be tweeted and start a \"language war\"; language comparisons are useless without the context of the constraints of the problem domain. For instance he had written C++ to be a performant language with the assumption of unix shell as the \"other language\". But what about Rust \"Zero Cost Abstractions\"? \"It's not good to pay for what you don't use.\" He admitted that since he coined the phrase \"Abstraction without overhead\" that indeed he admired the goal of Rust (getting close to the hardware for maximum performance) but hadn't been following their recent developments. For garbage collection... you shouldn't litter. http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html Languages are about solving problems so I am very familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of C++ and I know how to make it do quite a lot. But if I use another language then I am an amateur, not familiar with the idioms, and perhaps I will not use it so well. Any features you regret putting in or leaving out of C++? No, everything in there has a use and ... they have to stay or it would upset thousands of people. I wish it had better syntax, starting from C, well even they realized it was a mistake but it was already done so what are you going to do. Anything you put in a language, especially a mistake, will stay with you. Maybe you can put something off to release a product and know you will get back to it in an iteration or two. But make a mistake with a language and you live with it for a couple of decades. I do wish I had gotten some things right earlier. Templates. They solved the problem really well, general enough to do more than I imagined (that's the criteria for sucess). Nobody else at the time knew how to solve it but I wish the interface was better. Now, with the upcoming \"Concepts\", it will be better, but I wish I had done it right the first time. You have to understand, at the time of creation C was constrained to 64K, and C++ to 256K, so there are simply things you cannot do then. A complicated question about the N4047 modules proposal It was a good proposal. Isolating code from other portions to make compilation faster. C++ is maintained by people who actually pay 1280 to be on the committee... they don't make any money by doing it. Daveed Vandevoorde had to continue working and doing this proposal was something on the side. If it is not in my top 20 then it's not an important problem. So a lot of good proposals do not make my top 20. More recently teams in Microsoft, Google, GCC, and Clang are looking at this and some will even have implementations before it is released. It should be including in release 17 and you may see a compilation speedup between %50 and 50x , maybe more usually 4x or 8x faster. Language features are complicated as you have to coordinate between all of the major tool chains (you certainly can't have one of them do it one way and another differently). How many languages? When asked about whether a developer should focus on one language or learn many Bjarne had a very nuanced answer: When he started programming it was not impossible to learn 25 languages. It is very valuable to learn the different ways of thinking and solving problems by programming in a different language. Now though, languages are more complex with a lot of libraries, idioms, and toolchain to learn. So learning two languages, like the example before of 1 performant and 1 more general, would not be enough since that would not provide any comparison of why. Maybe 4, so that you could compare two general and two performant languages and understand how/why they did things differently. My Question I decided to mull over and try and ask a live question (with an audience this time). \"Given your comment about tooling before, how valuable do you find developer tools to a programming language (like an IDE)? Also, what are any major gaps you see in current tools?\" \"Good question. I don't really use tools that much since I work on smaller examples that might need to be ported in a few places. On larger projects and code bases tooling is very useful as you can't keep all of it in your head anymore. I'm maybe not the best person to ask, you probably work on large code more than I. But just being able to click on a macro or identifier and jump to it in the code is very useful.\" \"I don't use a debugger very often. Other people might but I don't. If you are using a debugger it's maybe a bad sign about your code. But I would like to see a debugger that could follow concurrency. That would really help.\" \"Tests are really important, so tools that make it easy to run tests, and to write tests quickly, that would be very useful.\" What is a professional? If someone, your employer or your manager, asks you to do something that is shabby you should just resign. It doesn't happen very often but there are ethics. I wish the Universities, that teach \"Computer Science\" and not programming, would spend some time on caching or real world coding and problems. They graduate being able to describe the Halting Problem but with magic constants throughout their code. It would be nice if there was a more universal way to explain/teach being \"professional\" in software. C++ in Education Bjarne was asked and clearly had some strong feelings on the subject of why C++ wasn't taught in universities. \"Perhaps it's because C++ doesn't have a marketing budget\" he quipped. More seriously he went on to point out \"he had very successfully taught college freshman programming in C++ so it's quite possible. There isn't enough time to teach all of C first so you don't start with that: for instance pointers are chapter 17, not chapter 2.\" More info An interesting interview he gave for comparison: http://www.stroustrup.com/CVu263interview.pdf","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/meeting-bjarne-stroustrup-creator-of-c-plus-plus-in-the-atlassian-dev-den/"},{"title":"Pragmatic testing, from Makefile to CI with Docker","text":"A colleague recently suggested \"Hey, why don't you run those tests from outside of the target server under test?\" And I thought to myself, \"Hmm.... why are we doing it that way? Was I just dumb when I did this the first time? The answer is the journey of successfully testing a successful product and the pragmatic choices made along the way. I believe that engineering requires compromises because without achieving short term progress we would have never reached our bigger, long term goals. Humble beginnings with Makefile Our initial project was to deliver an OVA (open virtualization archive) that packaged all of the services (and dependencies) into an easy to deploy and maintain virtual appliance. Will, as the project lead, had already spent some time setting up the build environment using vStudio and an Ubuntu ISO but one of our first issues after generating an OVA was to try and determine if it was \"good\". Could it even be deployed? Did it have the services installed correctly? I leveraged the Makefile that we were already using for the build to create a \"test\": deploy the latest OVA artifact and check that it was basically sound. This was a good start as, at the very least, we could quickly determine and bisect where we were producing bad builds. Adding some tests, but where? Once the initial spike (\"tracer bullet\") was done I began adding in selenium python based tests to verify the Web UI interface. Since our Continuous Integration system was basically bash and Makefile (which was also our build system) I opted to run the tests from inside of each deployed Virtual Machine. This allowed for isolation of the test execution from the build process and for each test run. While not ideal for product acceptance testing it provided a basic safety net that allowed us to know if a breaking change occurred upstream and was the first automated verification (followed by lots of manual testing) of the exact OVA we were shipping to Customers in the Beta. Bamboo Continuous Integration for visibility and the team A further improvement was to improve visibility of the test results. In parallel, after the team discussion during \"HipCon\" and with motivation from Don and Sam, I setup a private Bamboo installation in our VM area and helped get Integration tests setup for our upstream backend code. Once again I stuck with the tried and true \"tests inside of the target virtual machine\" pattern as the Bamboo server was only using \"local agents\" and I was concerned about trying to maintain a clean environment and the resources required as the number of test plans scaled. Additionally I migrated all of the previous test plans from the \"build factory\" into Bamboo which really helped with failed test visibility and tracking over time. The unit tests continued to run in a different SaaS version of Bamboo so I avoided scope creep and left things that were working alone. Migrating to a managed service One of the most asked questions whenever a new person joined was \"Why are the tests spread across so many different servers/services\"? I had to answer that question so many times! The answer basically boiled down to \"the testing grew organically as different people in the team solved the problem they faced\". Unsatisfactory? \"Be the change you seek\" didn't seem to get anyone else to solve the problem for me ;) Using the opportunity presented by a service outage issue I pushed forward a plan I had to migrate all of the test plans into a newly provisioned Bamboo server run by Build Engineering. (awthanks) There was an awesome team effort by a lot of people to make that happen (made even more challenging by doing it when the source service was out). (awesome) This solved quite a few problems: The Unit, Integration, and Product Acceptance tests were all finally combined under one roof... one UI to rule them all! New people joining the team needing access to Bamboo: since I hadn't linked it to any directory/authentication I was adding users manually - we were finally able to leverage an Atlassian backend Directory system I had been managing upgrades and maintenance of the Bamboo software (not fun and not my core expertise) I began to worry about the resource consumption (since this was running on hardware that also provided for our Build Factory) - no longer a worry with lots of Remote Agents and Elastic Agents (all provided by Build Engineering) Bonuses: More plugins and capabilities and knowledge from the Bamboo server and Build Engineering expertise Plan Templates to keep test plans in version control and macros for common functionality A successful spike of using Docker for unit testing With so much going on during the migration I avoided changing the testing paradigm, so tests continued to execute inside of each VM/EC2 Instance deployed. (shrug) Adopting Docker and refactoring Remember that question at the beginning? When something goes wrong, while it makes sense to separate \"fixing it\" from \"improving it\" I'm a big fan of taking advantage of having the hood open to go the extra mile and leave the campground cleaner =) So some of the selenium based tests were failing and it occurred to me that some of how we were changing our dependency infrastructure at the operating system level could be the cause. After some unproductive poking around I tried to reproduce and isolate the issue by running the tests from outside of the VM. Aha! In that moment I realized that this was actually the desired (original intention, honest!) way to run the blackbox product acceptance tests. So I pulled up my sleeves and tried out the \"hot fancy new silver bullet technology that solves every problem\". Why Docker? Docker encourages design of modular, deterministic and defined, single purpose components that are easy to reuse and compose into larger services. Not only are (Docker) Containers fast, one of the biggest advantages of Containers is the ability to reduce complexity. Docker can turn an application/service, it's dependencies, and even the OS level requirements into a single blackbox package (that you can still inspect inside if you really want to). So I built a Docker Image containing python selenium and http://phantomjs.org/ (a headless javascript based browser) and other dependencies. Sure enough I the tests passed when leveraging the previous Docker spike to run my new docker container. (success) Refactoring the bamboo plan (since it was leveraging Plan Templates and the Groovy DSL macros) didn't take too long and with other stakeholders PR/approval we're moving full speed ahead towards the \"ideal\" solution. (It only took about 2 years). Dogfooding the whole way Something I should mention that has been an invaluable companion throughout the course of building the product: a dogfooding server. \"Eating our own dog food\" is a wonderful way to experience the exact pain you are inflicting on your users. From the very begininng Will setup and we maintained a dogfood server which received every beta upgrade (and a few upgrades that never reached the customers), amazingly it's still alive and full of data! Not only did I learn about bugs that would affect our oldest and most loyal users (who kept with us and kept upgrading), I also felt the User Experience pain of how long upgrades took, mysterious incomprehensible errors messages, and \"partial upgrades\". All of these learnings, along with being Developer on Support and assisting on support tickets, kept me honest and humble and allowed me to improve the product just as much as any fancy testing automation framework. What does this all mean? It's easy to draw up how things should work according to best practice. It's even easier if it's work that someone else has to do and there aren't any deadlines. Success comes in stages. Overengineering and premature optimization cost way more in opportunity cost and thrown away work than doing things the \"wrong way\". This story could be massaged to fit a parable of \"Lean and Agile\" but it's really just common sense about transparently understanding the cost/value tradeof of the work, solving the current needs, and moving forward onto something better (by keeping informed of new solutions) when the opportunity shows up.","tags":"build-CI-CD-devops","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/pragmatic-testing-from-makefile-to-ci-with-docker/"},{"title":"HAProxy in Docker","text":"Not only are Containers fast, one of the biggest advantages of Containers is the ability to reduce complexity.

Caching often involves a \"Key Value Lookup\": A request is received and the service checks the cache using a Key The cache does not contain the Key The service generates the result from the originating data source (i.e. database) The service then stores the result in the cache with the Key as the index (and the result as the Value) A subsequent request is received and the service checks (looks up) the cache using a Key The cache does contain the Key The service retrieves the Value from the cache and returns the result A more concrete example would be to cache a User object by Email, so that whenever a request came in for a particular Users details the cache would contain their Name, Address, and Phone Number. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array Why Cache? A tradeoff of memory for cpu (or latency or some other business cost). computation is expensive (in terms of cpu, time, or money) accessing the data from source is too slow access to data across a larger geographic distance the data actually comes from multiple sources (complex and expensive to retrieve) to reduce load on the service originating data to reduce contention (i.e. reads not served from the same persistence that does writes) server side caching can protect backend resources and improve throughput and performance for a client-server architecture, caching on the client reduces the number of required connections to a server Questions to ask when caching Is the complexity of caching worth the performance gain? (a simpler implementation is often better, less chance of bugs!) Does my cache need to be consistent? (meaning the cache and data source return identical results) Can my cache be \"eventually consistent\"? (meaning a wrong answer for some specified period of time is ok) Am I caching at a high level? (meaning aggregating a lot of work/responses from lower level systems) Am I caching at a low level? (meaning inside of my Data Access Object pattern I'm protecting a single simple resource, i.e. a MySQL table, from being accessed too often) How unique are my Keys in my cache (i.e. if multiple users can have the same identifier it would be very bad to return the wrong session to the wrong user) Do I have the ability to operate or pay for a caching service? What will happen if the cache is unavailable? Cache Latency Times in Perspective Taking \"why cache\" to another level, the relative speeds of different cache levels highlight why some applications or algorithms will fail if they do not leverage cache. If your application uses a very large amount of data the network may actually be better than disk; optimization would probably not be focused on \"loop unrolling\" If your application depends on data across the internet then network caching, routing algorithms, and data modeling (eventual consistency!) may be more important than \"tail recursion vs iterative\" Action nanoseconds microseconds milliseconds human scale comparison A typical cpu instruction 1 ns 1 second basis (approximations) L1 cache fetch 0.5 ns Branch misprediction 4 ns L2 cache fetch 7 ns 7 seconds Mutex lock/unlock 25 ns RAM \"main memory\" fetch 100 ns 0.1 us 2 minutes Read 4K randomly from SSD 100,000 ns 100 us 28 hours Read 1 MB sequentially from memory 250,000 ns 250 us 3 days Send 1000 bytes over 1 Gbps network 500,000 ns 500 us 0.5 ms 6 days Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD 1,000,000 ns 1,000 us 1 ms 12 days Spinning Hard Disk seek 8,000,000 ns 8,000 us 8 ms 3 months Read 1 MB sequentially from disk 20,000,000 ns 20,000 us 20 ms 7.6 months Packet Roundtrip SF to NY 70,000,000 ns 70,000 us 70 ms 2 years Packet Roundtrip SF to NY 150,000,000 ns 150,000 us 150 ms 5 years The L1 cache is the memory cache integrated into the CPU that is closest Light travels 30 cm or about 1 foot in 1 nanosecond ns = nanoseconds, us = microseconds, ms = milliseconds http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers (Peter Norvig) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive#Controller http://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/episode-45-caching-overview-and-hardware/ https://wondernetwork.com/pings https://twitter.com/rzezeski/status/398306728263315456/photo/1 (Brendan Gregg) Caches are another Operational component with Overhead The best advice is to definitely avoiding caching until the last possible moment ( \"less is the best\" and \"premature optimization\" and \"be future flexible\" and \"defer architecture decisions\" ) Not only do you have to write code complexity for using a cache, there's the nitty gritty of running a cache (which can be a completely different expertise than programming) Install Deployment Upgrades Security Monitoring Metrics Testing (i.e. synthetic smoke tests or load) None of this operational cost is free, and there are plenty of issues when just implementing caching in the code... \"High Level\" caching for the application versus \"Low Level\" caching for the persistence layer Caching can be the most effective at the \"highest\" layer where the application is able to trivially service a request. (e.g. caching the final full web page that was requested) This \"protects\" all of the underlying machinery from having to do work. It requires a good understanding of how dynamic or personalized the results are, designing the system to have pieces that can be cached, and is brittle to change. Caching can be an \"easy win\" when applied at the \"lowest\" layer right near the persistence (i.e. redis \"in front of\" a database - that for example contains the new articles that will be served on a web page) as all of the components in layers above can benefit from improved performance without having to change the business logic (or perhaps even unaware of the caching). Both can be used together but to paraphrase: \"mo caching mo problems\" How to Cache Cache on Write Also known as \"cache on write through\", whenever new data is written a cache must also be updated. Cache on Read Also known as \"cache on read through\", whenever a query is made first the cache is checked. If there is a \"cache miss\" then the data source is queried and the cache is updated and the result is returned. If there is a \"cache hit\" and the data is in the cache then it is returned (and potentially a cache key expiration updated as this cache hit improved the cache efficiency). Cache Warming Pre-emptively adding data to the cache is \"cache warming\" in order to improve \"cache hit\" percentages and reduce the risk of \"cold cache\" issues. Flush the Cache Removing some or all data from the cache in order to invalidate a chunk of data (i.e. all users need to reset their passwords) or pre-emptively free up memory/space. Common Gotchas Caching is challenging because of the need for data consistency, parallel requests, and race conditions. One good way to think about it is a banking system with money... If two people both try to empty a bank account at an ATM at the same time how will your caching system handle it? Cache on write gotchas There may be a design mismatch as since data is only cached on write, if reads are occurring mostly on data written a long time ago they will be expired/pushed out and you will have poor cache efficiency (paradoxically adding caching will have resulted in more complexity and worse performance). One implementation flaw is updating the cache first; if the update to the data source fails then some requests may have been given incorrect data. The opposite order of updating the canonical source first can have a similar problem if the process fails before the cache can be updated. (Thus leaving the cache with old data). First invalidating the cache reduces the risk of a failure during a write creating an inconsistent state Next update the data persistence (which should be provided as an atomic operation by your vendor ;) Finally update the cache In the worst case the canonical source will be updated without the benefit of caching One might also have a \"transaction\" defined around both the update of the origin and cache with retries for failure While \"cache on write\" is a sometimes band-aid for NoSQL \"eventual consistency\" when it fails (i.e. all applications should expect that a cache will not exist or have a cache miss) the result may be data inconsistency. One workaround is \"check and set\" (or \"compare and set\") where the cache will auto-invalidate if two conflicting entries are attempted. https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2011/08/compare-and-set-in-memcache.html This \"gotcha\" could be summarized as not handling rollback Expiration: a cache full of stale junk A naive implementation of caching will store every result in the cache forever... While this seems like a good idea ( \"The cache application/service will just evict unused items based some algorithm\" ) it is essentially forcing your cache to be full of potentially low value information on the hope that someone else will solve the problem. Since some caching tools/framework do not set a default Time To Live or Expiration and in that case all of your data may quickly fill up the cache (not a bad thing per se), but then it will use whatever default or global \"eviction policy\" that is defined. Even O(1) can be broken by a pathological data set, and keeping every item seems like a good way to find an edge case (i.e. hash collisions and chaining). Applying business logic and empirical data to pick sane expiration values might not only improve cache performance but may protect your service from security issues or bugs due to serving really stale data. e.g. for security reasons, caching a session \"forever\" is a bad idea as an attacker may get access to an old client cache or token and be able to impersonate a legimate user Issues with Expiration Set Too Long: Security concerns Lack of control/non determinism for when and what items might be evicted Poor performance, memory pressure, and possibly increased operational cost Stale data Large cache sizes may end up writing to disk (i.e. redis sync to disk may use copy on write) Set a TTL or Expiration, whenever possible, that matches your domain (i.e. for a session 1 day or 1 week). If the Time to Live is too short then the cache may have very poor efficiency (items expire before they can generate even one cache hit), meaning all of the coding and operational cost are for nothing =[ Cold Cache and the Thundering Herd If the cache is \"cold\", i.e. has not been populated, then all queries will go directly to the source If the source is not prepared for the \"thundering herd\" of requests (that were usually handled by the cache) then the source may become overloaded and bad things will happen It is therefore best practice to \"warm the cache\" by seeding data from the source into the cache before significant load events Cold cache not only can cause problems from the source but when lot of data is written simultaneously to the cache, if the cache uses underlying disk or some other IO resource, it may temporarily overwhelm the cache (system/framework). Upgrading your application In a sense the cache layer is an external persistence that has to stay in sync with the application code; they are logically and semantically bound together. Modification to your application code, specifically the way it reads and writes to the cache, may return \"bad\" data. Cache key \"admins\" stored a list of usernames of admin users for the application Cache key \"ausers\" stored a list of usernames that begin with the letter \"a\" An application upgrade occurs Now the code has a bug that looks up \"ausers\" in order to give administrator permssions (oops) Spanning Multiple Keys If you need to retrieve multiple items from a cache in order to fulfill a request you may run the risk of \"torn reads\" where the first item retrieved from cache is logically inconsistent with the second item. Tools for caching Much like encryption it is probably a good idea to use a time tested caching component over writing your own implementation. A local in memory cache is a tried and true way of speeding up an application but it may not provide the transparency and visibility when there are bugs. While it seems trivial to setup it will slow down your dev velocity on your high value focus area and every new feature you realize you need (automatic expiration, authentication, etc.) will create a distraction and eventual maintenance requirement. Instead there are quite a few very popular battle tested options... Memcached http://memcached.org https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached https://hub.docker.com/r/_/memcached/ docker run --rm -it --publish 11211:11211 --name mymemcached memcached:alpine echo -e 'add foo 0 60 11\\r\\nhello world\\r' | nc localhost 11211 telnet localhost 11211 get foo VALUE foo 0 11 hello world https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Commands Redis Examples Redis has surpassed memcached in terms of speed and functionality and if you need to store more than \"just a string\" you should experiment with it. Besides having a cache to speed up lookups for your application or as a globally shared cache (be careful!) between multiple application serveers there can be a nice convenience as a \"meta\" persistence such that you can deploy a new version of your application and not lose all of the data in the cache. One thing to think about is that local redis might be far more effective than remote over the network redis. If your application can depend less shared state this is good because sharing is a nightmare for cache semantics and distributed computing. When possible avoid a globally shared cache between multiple processes or servers, or invest in learning about atomic operations Regardless of whether you securing your remote cache (or just depend on network isolation) you will always want to measure cache effectiveness.

Build python from source wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/Python-2.7.8.tgz tar -xf Python-2.7.8.tar.gz cd Python-2.7.8 ./configure --prefix=/home/ubuntu/python --enable-unicode=ucs4 make && make altinstall /home/ubuntu/python/bin/python2.7 --version altinstall ensures we do not try to override the existing /usr/bin/python binary which can be important if you want python 2.7.3 and python 2.7.8 to exist side by side Optionally: echo 'alias py=\"/home/ubuntu/python/bin/python2.7\"' >> ~/.bashrc python3 from source wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.2/Python-3.4.2.tgz tar -xf Python-3.4.2.tar.gz cd Python-3.4.2 ./configure --prefix=/opt/python3.4.2 && make -j$(nproc) && make altinstall ls -ahl /usr/local/bin | grep 3.4 /usr/local/bin/pip3.4 install --upgrade virtualenv If you mess up your OS level python apt-get install python3 python3 depends on dh-python; however: Package dh-python is not configured yet.

Much like AWS cloud servers (api based dynamic deployment that should be tolerant of node failure) and automated deployment/configuration infrastructure (chef or puppet such that cloud servers are created idempotent, remotely and automatically managed at scale), Docker requires a change of mindset. Docker encourages design of modular, deterministic and defined, single purpose components that are easy to compose into larger services.

For DNS with docker installed onto ubuntu via apt-get, try changing to Google DNS by uncommenting in: vi /etc/default/docker sudo service docker restart Building images often depends on dependencies look closely at error messages, i.e. make: not found and ensure that an early RUN statement has apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential Discovering an Image Parent from History To see all of the images in detail: docker images --all --digests=true python 2.7-alpine sha256:834b44717d3928266472066d82208241a2582ce7b3787f32abbfb0def9fb0324 c80455665c57 6 weeks ago 71.49 MB alpine latest sha256:dfbd4a3a8ebca874ebd2474f044a0b33600d4523d03b0df76e5c5986cb02d7e8 88e169ea8f46 6 weeks ago 3.984 MB And then you can brute force query to see if an image has child dependencies: for i in $(docker images -q); do docker history $i | grep -q 7fb9bd20d612 && echo $i; done More Info Real World example of using Docker for behind the firewall delivery: https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/ac-koa-hipchat-sassy/pull-request/6/readmemd-contains-instructions-on-how-to/diff https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet http://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/06/23/docker-ssh-considered-evil Docker API and the Docker Hub Public Registry Docker used to have an API endpoint at registry.hub.docker.com/v1 but in a fairly typical move for them they changed it so a lot of internet \"documentation\" examples are wrong. Also the Docker Hub was deprecated as of 1.7 so this is the last docs on how to use it (because the service is still running or compatible) curl https://index.docker.io/v1/_ping true It uses basic authentication and while you can use the API to sign up it may just be easier to use the web site: https://hub.docker.com/ curl https : // username : password @index . docker . io / v1 / users / \"OK\" just curl with basic auth in order to check the credentials, the trailing slash is IMPORTANT Using a browser with the Docker REST API is often more convenient as it caches the Basic Authentication https://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/docker-io_api/#users https://docs.docker.com/v1.6/reference/api/registry_api/ (because the registry api was deprecated earlier?) To see all of the images for a given repository (it is json formatted and there will be a lot of results!) curl https://username:password@index.docker.io/v1/repositories/python/images https://docs.docker.com/v1.6/reference/api/registry_api/ If you docker search python and want to see the tags (i.e. you do not want to pull every python image ever made), then try curl with REST: curl

Using your Build/CI/CD server to grab the latest themes/plugins is a mistake because while you would benefit from any new features and bug fixes you will also get burned (yes it has happened to me!) when you are publishing a blog post and suddenly your site doesn't work. (Oh are you using Continuous Post Deploy Smoke Tests and Realtime Everything Monitoring to detect this on your blog?) I highly recommend \"vendoring\" by copying pelican-elegant into the themes subdirectory in your version control. This sort of pinning makes an explicit choice that will ensure your site will continue to work until you choose to next upgrade. Pinning in the Build/CI/CD server by git sha will also work but makes it harder to keep everything in one place for development. The drawback of \"vendoring\" is the technical debt by the inevitable customization that occurs in this \"directory separated\" fork of the original Pelican Plugins https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins mkdir plugins cp -a pelican-plugins/sitemap plugins/ note this is the lazy way, a more precise way would be to only copy in the plugins used Hacking ListJS and per Article word count into a theme Basically once you get the hang of the config file format (just python really) and the templating engine (HTML with some jinja2) you can add all sorts of interesting pieces.

Unfortunately there were edge cases around the encodings of spaces, pluses, slashes, etc. where nginx + Cumulus was returning \"Access Denied\" when trying to GET a file. Examining the relevant RFC's ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1 ), PHP ( http://php.net/manual/en/function.rawurlencode.php ) and Python ﻿( http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html ) references, and examining the logs, I could see the files were PUT correctly, s3cmd could retrieve the binary objects (files) from Cumulus fine... but the logs were showing a change in the URL's. Increasing the debugging in nginx , digging into the Cumulus source code and nginx AWS Authentication Module (and adding more logging statements in Python and C respectively), I realized there was a mismatch in the REST URL signature process. Since Cumulus was using the open source Python Boto library which is actually supported by Amazon (the de facto rulers of the S3 \"standard\"), I decided that their signing process was authoritative. A lot of digging into nginx configs and source, along with learning a bit about nginx module development and hacking the source of the ngx_aws_auth module, I finally came up with a matching signature process, (success!) ngx_aws_auth/ngx_http_aws_auth.c /* uses the source and length to copy the uri, does not escape characters (the argument signature is compatible with ngx_escape_uri) */ uintptr_t ngx_uri_extractor ( u_char * dst , u_char * src , size_t size , ngx_uint_t type ) { while ( size ) { * dst ++ = * src ++ ; size -- ; } return ( uintptr_t ) dst ; } /* customized to calculate the signature using the non escaped URI, compatible with cumulus boto */ static ngx_int_t ngx_http_aws_auth_variable_s3 ( ngx_http_request_t * r , ngx_http_variable_value_t * v , uintptr_t data ) { ngx_http_aws_auth_conf_t * aws_conf ; unsigned int md_len ; unsigned char md [ EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE ]; aws_conf = ngx_http_get_module_loc_conf ( r , ngx_http_aws_auth_module ); /* * This Block of code added to deal with paths that are not on the root - * that is, via proxy_pass that are being redirected and the base part of * the proxy url needs to be taken off the beginning of the URI in order * to sign it correctly. */ u_char * uri = ngx_palloc ( r -> pool , r -> uri . len + 200 ); // allow room for escaping /* u_char *uri_end = (u_char*) ngx_escape_uri(uri,r->uri.data, r->uri.len, NGX_ESCAPE_URI); */ u_char * uri_end = ( u_char * ) ngx_uri_extractor ( uri , r -> unparsed_uri . data , r -> unparsed_uri . len , NGX_ESCAPE_URI ); * uri_end = '\\0' ; // null terminate ... }","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/cumulus-compatible-s3-nginx-and-hmac-signed-requests/"},{"title":"Selenium headless browser automated testing with PhantomJS and Python","text":"Why Automated Testing Automated Testing is critical to maintaining quality while increasing velocity (aka avoiding being crushed to death by technical debt). Web sites are inherently complex to test: requires a client and server, combination of UI and Logic, lots of paths, etc A challenge facing the HipChat team is how to maintain quality while supporting both SaaS and BTF versions, expanding the team, increasing the functionality, and experiment with architecture (or even just normal bug fixing refactoring). Choosing Selenium Continued innovation by the Selenium project has created a stable and usable programmatic interface such that clicking on different components in a web page can be automated. Selenium tests can be generated manually by a Firefox plugin https://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/ and then saved to a .html file which is helpful in that it can be done by non programmers. Eessentially selenium as a Domain Specific Language creates artifacts rather than tribal knowledge. The Selenium Documentation is overly complicated by legacy versions just use the IDE, play with the record button and click on stuff, save the .html, and analyze and you'll quickly get the hang of it.

Having a huge suite of IDE based tests incurs potentially unsustainable technical testing debt (e.g. investigating/rewriting why/when many tests fail). And requiring a testing machine with a UI with a browser etc. is a lot of overhead if you intend on (correctly!) running the tests really often. Converting raw .html tests to a specific language binding (i.e. moving more to WhiteBox) can remove non essential parts of the test and increase flexibility (multiple browsers!). sudo pip install selenium installation assuming linux and python Example Selenium Python Webdriver The IDE helpfully not only can save a Test but can File -> Export Test Case As -> python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException import unittest , time , re class SeleniumLogin ( unittest .

Git Cheat Sheet git branch see the current branch git status are there any files changed? git stash save and hide any modified files to a temporary cache git checkout master set the local working files to the shared canonical branch (aka \"master\") git pull get and merge any changes, many others prefer the more precise git fetch git log examine the history of changes made upstream (consider pre-emptively how the merge will affect things) git checkout mybranch change the focus back to the working dev branch git pull ensure the local working files from the branch are the latest (i.e. if other contributors or devices have made modifications) git merge master force reconciliation of master and the current working branch RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN THE CODE MANUALLY one thing to remember is that \"merge\" is best effort so sometimes code/lines will be added or removed that are not the desired semantic outcome git commit indicate a merge from master and any conflict resolution fixes git push never force , the changed branch may be worked on by others and a forked history means no reconciliation... Extra Credit cp -a FOOBAR /tmp manually back up the files git checkout -- ./name reset a single changed file back to the previously committed version git log ; git revert COMMITID identify a mistaken commit and create a commit to undo all changes until the working files (and git history) match that specific commit id git reset --soft HEAD&#94;&#94; correct and recommit change A, then go back to recommitting change B git reset HARD reset all of the working files to a previously committed version rm -rf FOOBAR; git clone throw away entirely a locally copy and start again from the remote version Simple Git Theory Distributed Version Control Directed Acyclical Graph Any branch can be \"master\". But in practice most developes use an agreed centralized location (i.e. good availability/uptime), especially a SaaS like github or bitbucket. Basic Git Commands git clone SSH is far more convenient and secure git clone HTTPS is common for \"read-only\" downloads of an open source project git add --all . the extra parameter ensures new files are added (which I otherwise forget), and as a bonus will detect file/directory renaming git log Show the history of commits (and hashes) git rebase -i interactively rewrite git history, NEVER do this on a shared/collaborative branch/repository Remove a large file from history git filter-branch --tree-filter \"rm -rf VeryLargeDirOrFileName\" -f HEAD --all https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch git rev-list --objects --all | grep \"$(git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/*.idx | sort -k 3 -n | tail -10 | awk '{print$1}')\" Split a subdirectory into its own repo git subtree push --prefix examplesubdir https://bitbucket.org/USERNAME/examplereponame master whoa, one line to take a subdirectory and push it into the waiting empty new repo https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/05/the-power-of-git-subtree/","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/git-basics-and-hard-to-scratch-itches/"},{"title":"Logic Puzzles","text":"How to have two 1 hour uneven burning fuses burn for 45 mins? light only ONE end burn both ends = 30 mins when it finishes, light the other end Three light bulbs are all off in one room, three light switches in another... ...If you can't see the bulbs from the switch room, how can you tell which connects to which if you can only enter the bulb room once? Flip the first switch for one bulb for many minutes, then turn it off. Flip the second switch on. Enter the bulb room, the bulb on connects to the second switch, the warmer of the two bulbs off is the first switch. At night 4 people arrive at one side of a bridge... ...that can only support 2 people at a time and they have only one flashlight. If each were alone here's how fast they could cross: the first in 15 minutes, the second in 10 minutes, the third in 2 minutes and the fourth in 1 minute. If the flashlight only has 17 minutes how do they cross? The 1 minute and 2 minute cross together (takes 2 minutes). The 1 minute returns (total is now 3 minutes). The 10 and 5 minutes cross together (total is now 13 minutes). The 2 minute returns (the total is now 15 minutes). Finally the 1 minute and 2 minute cross again (17 minutes and complete). 3 bags contain all oranges, all apples, or a mix of oranges and apples... ...BUT the label on each definitely is incorrect. How do you find out which bag has what and how many bags to you need to open? Choose the one labeled \"mixed\" and if it contains apples, therefore the remaining bag which is labelled oranges must not contain all oranges and so must be the mixed one. There are 3 red hats and 2 blue hats in a bag.... Andrew, Bob, and Carol each reach into the box and place one of the hats on their own head. They cannot see what color hat they have chosen. Then they sit down all facing in the same direction: Andrew <-- Bob <--Carol Such that Carol can see what color Bob and Andrew are wearing. Bob can see what color Andrew is wearing. Andrew can't see anyone's hats. The first person to say what color hat they are wearing wins. The winner of the game gets a billion dollars... But if they guess wrong, they die... so nobody wants to try \"just guessing\"... SO... after they grab their hats and sit down, a long time passes... Eventually somebody says \"I have the answer\" and successfully states what color hat they have. Since Carol can see Andrew and Bob, if they both were wearing blue hats she would immediately know that she was wearing red, so unlikely that a long time would pass before she answered (and take the money)... Therefore Andrew and Bob have one red hat and one blue hat. (And Carol knows there's a 33% chance she's got a blue hat and a 66% chance she's got a red hat). Since Bob knows that Carol delayed in answering \"a long time passes\" AND he can see the color of hat that Andrew is wearing, then Either Andrew is wearing a blue hat, and therefore Bob must be wearing a red hat. Or Andrew is wearing a red hat, and therefore Bob must be wearing a blue hat. Bob successfully answers... (unless Carol is more interested in sadistic plots and even though she knows both Bob and Andrew have blue hats she just waits to watch Bob get it wrong...) NOTE: this variation from the NY Times is slightly incorrect as it is essentially asking why Andrew wins... The clue in order for \"Andrew\" to know (the delay) is the same as what Bob uses, but Bob will be able to deduce it much faster. (Again, Carol could be deliberately waiting to watch Andrew fail too...) http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/the-puzzle-of-the-3-hats One ball of 8 weighs more than the other 7, how can you identify it with two measurings of a balance scale? Weigh 3 vs 3, if they match then weigh one of the \"good\" ones against one of the remaining ones, if they're unequal you have the heavier one, if they're equal then the last is the heavy one. If the 3 vs 3 do not match then take two of the heavy side and weigh them against each other: if they're unequal you have the heavier one, if they're equal then the last of the heavy side is the heavy one. One ball of 12 weighs more OR less than the other 11, how can you identify it and whether it's heavier or lighter with three measurings of a balance scale? Weigh 4 vs 4, label them ABCD and EFGH. If they balance then weigh \"good\" ABC against WXY. If the second weighing balances then weigh Z against A to see if Z is light or heavy. If the second weighing has WXY heavier or lighter (make a note of which as we have solved whether the imbalance is heavy or light), then weigh W with X. If they balance then Y is the imbalance from step 2 (heavier or lighter). If they do not balance then whichever matches the imbalance from step 2 is the off ball. IF at the first weighing ABCD was lighter than EFGH, in the second weighing rotate such that ABCZ is weighed against D with \"good\" XYZ. If ... Note that this problem can also be solved by carefully measuring the results as the left and right groups of 4 are rotated. 12 becomes 4 v 4 v (4) - if the balance the last 4 are easy if not balanced: 1,2,5 vs 3,6,12 5 pots of 10g coins BUT one contains 9g coins, which pot is off by measuring the weight once? 1 from pot 1, 2 from pot 2, 3 from pot 3, 4 from pot 4, and 5 from pot 5 Expected weight should be 150g: if it's 149 then pot 1 , if it's 148 then pot 2, etc. How can you use a weighted coin (i.e. head more than tails) and still create a fair system of flips? Aggregate the outcomes: treat two flips as a single result such that heads then tails = Heads, and tails followed by heads = Tails. 10 are heads of N coins, how to create 2 groups that have the same number of heads up? Take any 10 from N and flip them (inverted will mirror the number of heads in the N - 10 group) 3 colors of socks: how many to take out until you have a pair? 4 (1 of each and the last 1 must match 1 of the first 3) 100 closed lockers, open all of the lockers on the first pass... ** ...close every 2nd locker on the second pass, on the third pass and for every 3rd locker open it if it's closed, close it if it's open.

Mostly integration) Performance and DevOps and Operations With hardware having kept up with Moore's Law and \"the cloud\" providing so much elastic compute, performance is now often an afterthought. Additionally, how to quickly and efficiently deliver software has coalesced into the term DevOps. The big idea being that software that is not actually running is not very valuable ;) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing http://jmeter.apache.org/ http://www.opensourcetesting.org/category/performance/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps https://www.atlassian.com/devops https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/ http://www.se-radio.net/2015/02/episode-221-jez-humble-on-continuous-delivery/ I know it sounds crazy that Computer Science practitioners (or Developers) should sully their hands with \"Operations\" but to truly understand the problem domains watching the logs or responding to an outage can vastly change how we write code. Importantly, seeing latency, traffic volume, and environmental issues makes us thankful when we do get back to the keyboard and can just focus on the theoretical aspects of a problem.","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/best-computer-science-online-and-a-more-complete-education/"},{"title":"Jinja2, a web html template layout for everyone","text":"Web development used to be so hard (and static).

I love building servers too and I've managed a small group of servers, I personally use Linode, and my currently company uses AWS and some internal servers... You would agree that in coding you pick the right tool for the job (scientific computing would use a different technology stack than a standard ecommerce startup website)... AWS is elastic (you pay a premium for being to scale up or down - and there's value to the agility with which you can change or add new services) AWS RDS is a huge improvement over managing MySQL replication, and they have Elastic Load Balancing and lots of other addons that take serious Ops chops to create and maintain Server operations cost is not the raw hardware: The biggest cost in Ops is people (same as coding), so leveraging Amazon saves on how many people you need to pay to manage your server farm (yes, SysAdmins take holidays and change jobs so cost = N+1 )... you can outsource half way by colocating but setting up the redundancy, monitoring, auto scaling, etc. becomes a physical pain (you want West Coast and East Coast servers, right?). The infrastructure of cooling, UPS, network (bandwidth!), backups, etc. is also a big factor in Operations (does your server room have building security? a backup generator?) My point is that for a stealth mode startup or any internal lab testing buying servers is a no brainer - do it with ESXi or OpenStack and hack away! BUT for Production you'll need some Cloud strategy (AWS competitors: RedHat OpenShift, RackSpace Cloud, IBM, ATT Compute, Google AppEngine, etc. means lower prices and improved services) Unless, as you've already mentioned, \"if you happen to have hanging around a pile of cash and tech expertise that's underutilized...\"","tags":"it","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/server-operations-cloud-versus-build-your-own/"},{"title":"Tomcat deployment on Openshift for free","text":"openshift is the cloud PaaS offering from RedHat Prerequisites and dependencies sudo apt - get update sudo apt - get install ruby1 . 9 . 3 git - core // yay for ubuntu 12 . 04 sudo gem install rhc // red hat openshift client OpenShift Client tools setup rhc setup Created local config file : / home / ubuntu /. openshift / express . conf The express . conf file contains user configuration , and can be transferred to different computers .

Software development is rather cheap when compared to physical manufacturing but that doesn't mean it doesn't cost money to create a product or service. The classic myth of the lone wolf hacker who creates a viral product runs counter to the reality of billions of dollars generated by the software industry. Elements of a Software Team Consider the many elements required to create a software product: Developers (hiring, location, communication, etc.) Developer tools (IDE, compiler, debugger, etc.) QA (you do run tests of some sort, don't you?!?!) Distribution/Release (shrink wrapped or delivered by Internet continuously, it still costs something) Support (assuming you've actually got users) Making Software Better, Faster, Cheaper What can you do to make your software cheaper, faster, and most importantly, better? 1. Use Open Source (like facebook, twitter, google, netflix). Leverage the crowd and reduce your costs (e.g. not buying software licenses, not paying someone to audit your software licenses, etc.) Spending money on licenses becomes cost prohibitive for large successful organizations. More importantly, get the quality of years of development by lots of different perspectives. The homogeneous gets wiped out by a single cause, get diversified! Concerns about competitive advantage based on your supply chain (e.g. the myth \"using Open Source tools doesn't give you an edge\") are unfounded as: a. If your competitive advantage is a \"secret supplier\" then your business will go bust as soon as anyone else finds out your secret. b. If you're paranoid enough to worry your competitors are messing with your tools then you shouldn't trust a closed source vendor - keep it in the open where everyone's watching. Giving back to open source projects you depend on has a multiplier effect: a healthy community project is far cheaper than paying full time to support your critical requirements and has built in support and marketing. http://readwrite.com/2013/10/17/is-facebook-the-worlds-largest-open-source-company http://www.cnet.com/news/worlds-biggest-open-source-company-google/ http://techblog.netflix.com/2010/12/why-we-use-and-contribute-to-open.html 2. Standardization Consider the trend of large clusters of commodity hardware. Using the same internal development tools means it's easier to focus on the real problems and not get lost in translation. This doesn't mean sticking to old versions or being afraid to innovate, but make success a formula and not an accident. Larger efficiencies can be generated by getting a decent level of determinism in the workflow. This means use the same IDE, the same dependency libraries, communication channels, etc. If you have rock stars that can't learn the common tool or won't teach others why their method is better then you run the risk of a dysfunctional \"all-star\" time bomb. This also applies to fairness: office perks, salaries, etc. Make it an organization about transparent achievable results, not a labyrinth of back room exceptions. http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/08/building-with-legos.html http://www.quora.com/Why-hasn-t-Facebook-migrated-away-from-PHP http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/under-the-hood-at-google-and-facebook http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Development-at-Google 3. Reduced specialization (and silos) System Administrator's whose sole purpose is to watch machines is a dying breed. An army of QA who manually walk through the same test plan over and over is also legacy. Start with \"DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself\". Develop automation early and make the process simple and obvious. (i.e. Amazon's internal conversion to APIs http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis ). This also means avoiding purchasing hardware (and the associated inventory/maintenance/overhead). The more virtual servers you buy the larger volume discount you can negotiate. It's not entirely about cost: you're renting somebody else's implementation of best practice you need to make your product number one, distractions from that reduce velocity. Your feature set will continually grow. (Even with careful pruning). By looking at software as the solution to quality/delivery/maintenance/etc. you can reduce your running cost to a fraction of what it would be AND be able scale up quickly when you become wildly successful. Note: people are still irreplaceable but by having a lot more Developers (and less unique specialists) you can distribute the load more evenly. Getting more cross functional individuals means less silos and less communication gaps. The network mesh effect destroys productivity if everyone's a separate bottleneck. http://www.learningapi.com/blog/archives/000079.html http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/06/netflix-operations-part-i-going.html http://www.infoq.com/articles/sw-eating-silos https://hbr.org/2011/12/quiet-but-unsubtle-innovation.html 4. Make it real Code that lives solves problems and is valuable. Uncommitted, unused, and otherwise un-useful code costs money to debug and deconstruct; much worse it costs time. Continuous integration gets your stable unit tested code some real world bruises.

I love books, the distillation of the wisdom of the ages, and the libraries where they are enshrined and shared. Visiting a library is an exciting insight into the culture and values of a location. Encyclopedias, Dictionaries, and all manner of reference books were the compendium of answers; questions had to be researched (sometimes involving extensive legwork, detective work, and persistence). Digitization of books (e.g. encyclopedia on cd-rom) enabled huge improvement in the access and distribution of information. Physical bulletin boards and community centers are also places of information exchange; digital communication (modems!) transformed the reach and capacity. Television and Video, despite many attempts, has long remained a one way medium. (Though too there's something inherently relaxing about passive entertainment). The Internet (and especially Google search) means specialist websites and esoteric questions are a couple links away; it has also enabled crowd sourcing answers. I'm amazed at the speed and accuracy of answers aggregated by Wikipedia, StackExchange, Quora, etc. (which admittedly still require filtering and research for correctness and comprehension). It's gotten so that now I receive answers to questions which I didn't realize I had!","tags":"it","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/an-evolution-of-questions-and-answers/"},{"title":"Mid 2012 technology and business prediction for 2013 and beyond","text":"The well known perceived future business model is constant (mobile) targeted (user profiling) advertising (everywhere) with instant purchase (online + mobile) and delivery (streaming) So Apple (Android) + Facebook + Google + Amazon + (Netflix?) , right? I think there's more to think about: the infrastructure is the gold; Hardware Manufacturers (CPU + RAM + SSD), Servers, Routers, ISP's, Content Producers, Transaction Processing, Data and User Platforms. The new ecosystem is inherently more distributed (more users globally, more devices) and fragmented (more OS, Apps, Content Producers, etc.) than the \"Microsoft Era\". Complexity increases with more data to aggregate/index/filter and many smaller transactions: consider previously purchasing a single desktop, monitor, (Windows bundled with it) and MS Word + one or two apps (Quickbooks or Photoshop). Now it's a laptop + phone + tablet (Windows + Android + iOS), each with many apps (including online services like Facebook) and the challenge of maintaining a consistent view of security, data, and even application state. Business purchases used to be larger, even grouped for volume (i.e. a company orders 1,000 desktops + monitors at $1,500 a piece); now it's bring your own device ($500) and many small app and content purchases for 99 cents to $10. Companies that solve the multi platform and scalability problems (along with of course actually creating a product that fulfills a need or desire) will get bigger faster .

(Who's fault is it?) Good System Administrators are well paid but usually work on the invisible and complex \"back end\" and are on \"on call\". (Yes, your dinner, sleep, and other private activities will be interrupted.) A stable, in demand, career since it's hard to fire a good System Administrator but there's often a belief that the position could/should be outsourced. (Ever hear the story of the SysAdmin who was so good at automating server tasks and desktop deployments that he put himself out of a job?) The overly general term \"Operations\" is often applied. In non technology focused companies you might be managed by a Chief Operations Officer who is more concerned with facilities (buildings), logistics (trucks, ships, planes, etc.) or even janitorial services. If you're not careful, methodical, detailed, and cool headed then this may not be the right path for you. (Cynical is optional but it helps a lot). An IT Manager is like an Accountant Always asked to do more with less. In fairness an IT Manager gets to be more creative (legally) as innovation and change drive technological efficiency. Good IT Managers spend as little time as possible in meetings but can organize and automate the heck out of everything. Diagrams, Business Cases, Reporting, Schedules; not often a hands on role. Being in charge of IT resources is well paid and it's a stable career (you're in charge of the budget, right?) but when \"downsizing\" occurs you may be considered an acceptable loss (if your business cases prove you've saved/earned enough then it's usually a non issue). Gluing together services often means jugging time zones (remote contractors and services are the norm) and balancing/network internal departmental demands. If you're not good at understanding people or technology (yes you have to hire/fire people and purchase wisely) then this may not be the right path for you. A Developer is like an Artist Eccentric, misunderstood, and something rare for the Arts, well paid. Good Developers understand it's Art with a purpose and apply rigorous engineering principles to their work (since software runs things like airplanes and hospitals this is a good thing). It's well paid but sometimes unpredictable work (software project done = goodbye expensive labor), luckily there's an endless demand for the foreseeable future. (Interestingly it often takes awhile to discover a \"bad\" developer and even then employers are reluctant to let them go). If you're not creative and logical; unable to unriddle paradoxes (yes it's a required dependency but no we don't want it), or just don't want to spend most of your waking hours in front of a screen (human contact optional), then this might not be the right path for you.","tags":"leadership","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/technology-careers-part-1/"},{"title":"Test Driven Development Introduction and QA Domains","text":"Why Test Driven Development \"6% progress\" in engineering Cost: Organizations want to reduce the time and cost associated with releasing code including the post release support, debugging, and maintenance. Agility: TDD enables faster product reactions to market changes and more drastic product changes and continued extension of successful products Growth: it's a proven method for Organizations building a strong brand and looking for 6% compound growth, enables larger teams and rotation of personnel Individual Time: less time is spent in long debugging session or writing \"dead code\" (code that never reaches production for either Business reasons – i.e. no customer demand, or Engineering decisions – i.e. quality of the overall product never reaches a release point). Individual Careers: ability to work on more complex projects and clear contribution to business success Individual Satisfaction: confidence in what's been delivered and happier users Acceptance Test Driven Development Everyone agrees on done! Automated Tests create concrete artifacts for all stakeholders (i.e. PM, QA, Engineering, etc.) to understand scope, review progress, and agree on \"done\". This vastly improves inefficiencies in communication, scheduling, and manual testing. Design is codified into a common language of Tests: Specifications require less translation and have faster validation Deliverables are more accurate to the business needs and progress is more accurate Future maintenance and extendibility is built into the process Acceptance Tests do require more up front discussions (not coding!) and setup time for automation. Good tests must match production environments and requirements in order to be valid. Tests must be engineered well in order to give good results as they are a product too. TDD does not guarantee good designs, good thinking, or good code. It's up to people to make it work! (Unit) Test Driven Development Simple, easy, lean, fast, readable, and early. Testing should be easy so start small, ask questions, and get used to the world being upside down =) Tests must factor out Dependencies (helps design modularization and isolation) Tests must run fast (slow tests can be moved into Acceptance Testing) Consider writing tests in order of expected probability of occurrence (balanced by severity if coverage is missed) i.e. the most common usage is correct inputs generating correct output, next maybe 2% of invalid inputs will generate 85% of data corruption \"Happy Path\" verifies that the code will fulfill the functionality specifically asked for so these are the \"high value\" tests. Next verify most likely invalid inputs and important exception handling The law of diminishing returns: more tests means more code writing and more tests that require maintenance Tests uncover assumptions, dependencies, tight coupling, and duplication. Every Developer must be able to read and maintain the tests; it is a shared effort at making a better product so clarity and readability are critical. TDD Workflow Write Acceptance Test -> Run Acceptance Test -> Passes = Next TDD feature please = ) / &#94; AT Fails / | UT Passes / | Write Unit Test -> Run Unit Tests \\ &#94; UT Fails \\ | \\ | Write Code to make it pass Trivial Example using an \"Adding Positive Integers Only Calculator\" add( int a , int b) - testPositiveIntegerPlusPositiveInteger (\"happy path\") - testIntegerMinusPositiveInteger (invalid input) - testZeroPlusPositiveInteger (invalid input) - testStringPlusInteger (edge case invalid input: maybe the compiler does not catch this) \"Test Doubles\" using Stubs or Mocks (Factoring out dependencies) Using stubs or mocks we can focus testing only the code we've written, Stubs generally are simple hard coded ways to validate state. Source code examples of TDD add ( int a , int b ) { dependencyLibrary . adder ( a , b ) } Class dependencyLibraryStub extends dependencyLibrary { dependencyLibraryStub ( expectedResult ) Override adder ( int a , int b ) { return expectedResult } } Mocks are usually leveraged with a framework and can validate process, multiple interactions, as well as state. QA Domains Start Testing with the most used paths and most user visible areas. Find the most serious consequence -> force error handling or crash.

There is an absolute spectrum of password management that creates untenable risk (no password or simply the word \"password\") all the way to very low risk (100 random characters of every category changed every day) but at an unbearable overhead. While \"changing the highly complex password every 90 days\" is considered inefficient and draconian... What about at least changing the password once a year? While it's likely that an external attacker or disgruntled employee will use a compromised password immediately, it doesn't mean there isn't a good reason to choose a frequency of password change: If a sticky note attached to a laptop sold at a garage sale is still valid for the company's online bank account then you're in trouble. Reduce the risk, have a policy to manage that window of access to something you're comfortable with. Dependency Visibility The opportunity to improve your infrastructure is well worth the cost of finding every hard coded place that a password is embedded in your organization: The password was just changed You quickly find something is not working You either change the password back or refactor/reorganized and break the dependency Far better than: - a random event like a forgotten password reset by one individual in the organization - creates a mystery problem in mission critical systems for everyone else to track down But I use a password management tool! Password management tools have to store their passwords somewhere (hopefully encrypted). Over time there is a chance that a \"bad actor\" will end up with your local password store. Man in the middle attacks (NSA anyone?) can snatch credentials from secure channels. There is an even higher likelihood that the remote services you are using will be compromised (database or password hashes leak). Given time hackers can use rainbow tables and GPU based brute force attacks they will crack your password. Every time you change your password you reset the clock on every type of attack","tags":"it","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/yes-change-your-password-regularly/"},{"title":"Using find grep cut awk sort dd with files and text and listing files with ls","text":"There are amazing linux command line utilities that make finding and manpiulating files very easy create copy truncate Assuming you understand the basics like: touch example.txt make an empty file named file.txt echo \"hi\" >> example.txt append the hi content into example.txt, note that a single > will overwrite the contents cat example.txt | tee -a example2.txt display the contents of the file to the output console and also pipe the result to the tee utility which appends it to another file - tee is better than >> except that tee always returns 0 so if you have set -e then prefer > :> example.txt truncate the file without disturbing any existing readers of that file (e.g. zero a log without messing up an applications ability to write to the file) cp -a example.txt example2.txt copy archive which preserves timestamp (but will also overwrite the target - in this example probably zero bytes) rm example.txt remove a file, -f forces removal without a prompt, -rf to recursively force remove a file or directory be careful ls lists files in a directory ls /etc list the files and directories in the /etc directory ls -1 lists just the names (not including hidden .dot files or directories) in the current directory ls -1a lists just the names including hidden .dot files ls -ahl | grep -v IGNORETHIS exclude lines that match IGNORETHIS ls -f unsorted list of files which is the only way to work with directories with a very large number of files list directories ls -d */ list names of directories in the current directory ls -1 -d */ using a \"numeral one\" parameter lists one directory name per line ls -l -d */ using a \"lowercase letter L\" parameter lists the extended information (permissions, owner, timestamps) ls -d ./*/ list names of directories in the current directory echo */ lists the names of directories in the current directory find - type d find recursively starting from the current directory and display the relative path all objects of type directory find / tmp - maxdepth 1 - type d find all directories in /tmp up to 1 level deep (/tmp/foo) find / tmp - maxdepth 2 - type d find all directories in /tmp up to 2 levels deep (/tmp/foo/bar) counting the listings ls -1 | wc lists just the names of non hidden files piped to word count, number one looks a lot like lowercase L (sadindeed) ls -1 | wc -l list just names and count only the lines (number one, then lowercase L) ls -ahl | wc -l counting hidden files BUT directories too for file in /PATH/foo*;

Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness. Composition: Design programs to be connected with other programs. Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines. Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must. Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do. Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier. Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity. Representation: Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust. Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing. Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing. Repair: Repair what you can, but when you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible. Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time. Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can. Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it. Diversity: Distrust all claims for one true way. Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think. (Or, to put it another way, your creations will last longer than you think!)

See the very end for the workaround. (Note: having a 64 bit compiler should theoretically compile faster but with gcc 32 bit you can compile / target both 32 and 64 applications.) install JRE (64 bit) install Eclipse CDT (64 bit) install Wascana (mingw for eclipse) configure the path variable Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) A pre-requisite is to download the JRE (Java Runtime Environment, 5.0 or higher, newer is often better). FIRST, check if you have a 64 bit or older 32 bit system. If you have a 64 bit system, use a \"64 bit browser\" to go to the java page because otherwise it will keep giving you the 32 bit version to download... http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_win64bit.xml The link and filename should be something like: \"jre-6u22-windows-x64.exe\" Otherwise in Eclipse you may get the Error exit code=13 or \"failed to load the JNI shared library\"... This will most likely install in C:\\Program Files\\Java (or some variant). (with the \\bin\\javaw.exe) on Windows 7 the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ directory contains 32 bit installations/applications Install Eclipse CDT (64 bit) The base Eclipse CDT supports integration with the GNU toolchain but may not come with a compiler... All Linux distributions include the GNU toolchain (but might not be installed by default...) MinGW provides the best integration support with the CDT due to it's direct support for the Windows environment. If you download the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ you'll get the \"CDT\" plugins along with the default Eclipse platform: http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php The eclipse.ini file allows you to configure your program (e.g. specify the JRE location) (Notedpad2 or notepad++ handle the linux versus windows line breaks transparently...) e.g. insert the line to specify where your java run time environment is, maybe you have two... eclipse.ini -vm C:\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\javaw.exe Double clicking the eclipse.exe icon will start it with an empty Workbench (and use the default JRE) The first time you will be given the opportunity to choose your \"Workspace\" (aka directory where all of your files will be stored). I prefer to have it in the Eclipse folder but obviously in a multi user setup the \"My Docs\" or Network Folder would also make sense... or Dropbox? (DropBox -> Public might make Open Source Distribution even easier?) File -> New -> C Project Fill in the basics (you can choose the pre-made hello world app) Then click on the \"Go To Workbench\" so you can see the Project File Explorer, Code Editor, Console Window -> Preferences allows you to customize Eclipse e.g. disable usage statistics) Click on the hammer symbol (Build) to ensure that you create an object file (.o) before trying to test run an executable... gcc error Of course when you try to build you get an error...

After it downloads, installs, and restarts Eclipse you'll find the new mingw and msys directories in your Eclipse folder. Now you have to update the Path, in Windows it's usually under System Properties -> Advanced System Settings Environment Variables -> System Variables scroll area, highlight \"Path\" (click on the edit button) It should already have something like: %SystemRoot%\\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Wbem; Append a semi colon to continue the long list and add: c:\\eclipse\\mingw\\bin Apparently some people feel eclipse does not autodetect unless it's c:\\mingw (Theoretically you could also try installing MingW directly from their website, which I've done, but it again is not 64 bit). Always 32 mingw gcc (oops) Unfortunately fundamental flaw - even when using Eclipse 64 bit the Install New Software gets the Wascana 32 bit mingw gcc. The Workaround is to use the Wascana Desktop as a single download/install (which includes 32 bit versions of: JRE 1.6.0 , Mingw 3.4.5 , Eclipse IDE) More info http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/wascana/ Apparently inaccessible due to strange Google Code permissions issues Also try: http://mclserver.eecs.ucf.edu/trac/courses/wiki/COP3402Spring2011/InstallEclipseCpp","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/eclipse-ide-c-wascana-on-windows-7/"},{"title":"Drupal Security Tip: disabling anonymous access to cron","text":"Drupal is a wonderful way of leveraging many open source advanced web features into one interface that conceivably can be handed off to a \"non developer\" to maintain.

Running Drupal cron manually You can still run cron manually from either of the options below: Administer -> Reports -> Status http://example.com/admin/reports/status/run-cron There's even a way to schedule it to run against localhost or 127.0.0.1 (which is trusted in the .htaccess file we created above) Cron explained Cpanel -> Advanced -> Cron Jobs * * * * * http://example.com/cron.php (e.g. for rochen or bluehost cpanelx command should be the 8 char directory) php -q /home/yoursite/public_html/cron.php OR if you have multiple subdomains running different drupal installs: php -q /home/8chars/public_html/subdomain/cron.php Check using your drupal admin to ensure that the cron job has run Administer -> Reports -> Status This will allow you to test if your cpanel really has the correct permissions as Administer -> Reports -> Status should now show the cron job status as updated frequently! =) Here is a diagram of the general crontab syntax, for illustration: # +---------------- minute (0 - 59) # | +------------- hour (0 - 23) # | | +---------- day of month (1 - 31) # | | | +------- month (1 - 12) # | | | | +---- day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7) # | | | | | * * * * * command to be executed e.g. 59 23 31 12 * /bin/execute/this/script.sh the five stars (with a space in between each!) represent wildcards: when minute = 59 when hour = 23 when day = 31 when month = 12 every day (could be = 5 to limit it to only every friday) Update free access = FALSE /sites/default/settings.php should definitely have: $update_free_access = FALSE; Restricting file upload extensions Administer -> Site configuration -> File uploads \"Default permitted file extensions field\" for each role should be limited, because obviously you don't want ANONYMOUS users uploading .php files!

Higher income taxes motivates creating methods of long term wealth accrual, e.g. businesses with continual steady profits.

Well it's the core Blackberry experience (email + contacts + calendar) but only requires a data plan, not a special (expensive) Blackberry plan. The big item missing: Wireless activation is only available with BES dataplan. http://crackberry.com/blackberry-101-lecture-2-bes-and-bis-whats-difference The dilemma, if you already have a BES installation, can you setup a BESX too? \"the two BES servers cannot be in the same BES Domain, but can be in the same AD tree and access the same exchange server.\" \"provided BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express is introduced as a new deployment with its own BlackBerry domain, as defined by the BlackBerry configuration database... the BlackBerry Enterprise Server and BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express can run independently in the same Microsoft Exchange environment in a Microsoft Windows Domain and would be managed from separate BlackBerry Administration Service consoles.\" Apparently there is a difference between a BES Domain and a windows domain... Basically a BES Domain SHOULD only be the BES installation and Database, therefore you should be able to have multiple BES installations in the same Windows Domain (e.g. a large corporation with many exchange servers all in the same Windows Domain?).

Real life example of \"programming\" for success Goal: I want to play professional soccer find the position I am best at go to at least 3 tryouts Flow: fitness -> skills -> recognition Modular Parts: physical fitness skills networking and agent tryout special training camps + video of playing feedback from experts on my best position Tests: Must run 5km in under 18 minutes. Must sprint 40 yards in 5 seconds. Must be able to shoot the ball from 30 yards out into top quarter of the goal 10 out of 10 times Agent must have history of signing players to contracts Tryouts must show a history of players being brought into the team Sample Info: run 5km in 16 minutes sprint in 4.7 seconds 10 for 10 on shooting signed a contract with an agency who manages 100's of professional players scheduled 3 tryouts where players have been signed onto the first team every year Integration: If I attend a special training camp and give some professional coaches tapes of me playing in different positions I will receive suggestions on what is my best position (and possibly tips on how to improve at that position).

If you want a fixed (ie 1024px) css layout then rename layout-fixed.css to layout.css 12b. If you want a resizable css layout then rename layout-liquid.css to layout.css As the Drupal administrator login to your site and enable your new sub theme: Administer -> Site building -> Themes http://example.com/admin/build/themes/select you'll probably want to set it as default Apparently Drupal 6 is smart enough that when you click save: For easier theme development, the theme registry is being rebuilt on every page request.

Here's an example of me using my programming skills during the day for what might seem a simple request, \"Please add another PDF to a page on the Website\"... The first step was to upload the PDF into the database (so that it would be magically assigned a 4 digit number in the SQL).

Is writing a Script still programming? A script is a written set of instructions for a platform (usually an Operating System) that makes the computer (or hardware) do something. Sounds a lot like a Program! Well... A computer software program is usually source code (written by a human) that is then \"compiled\" into \"machine code\" which a machine can understand - except that there's also a linker and loader to figure out exactly what places in memory (and for what piece of hardware) the Program will run - finally turning it into Object code and then an Executable (usually called binary because it's in 1's and 0's directly in the language of the hardware). A script gives hardware a set of commands indirectly through another piece of software (it's environment/platform, e.g. DOS, Python, Windows OS, GNU Linux OS, etc.). The software then executes those commands (which often then tell an Operating System which then tells Hardware to to do something - like clearing the screen or adding some numbers). So maybe html is even less Programming like than a script! Since it only tells a browser (a specific application) how to format/display data!?!?! Ah, enough semanticarating! What happens if you're running a script and somewhere it requires user input? \"Expect\" is a piece of software that \"waits\" for input from the linux operating system command line... apt-get install expect to install it on linux (ubuntu) yum install expect to install it on linux centos/redhat touch test-script.sh create the file chmod +x test-script.sh make the file an executable in linux nano test-script.sh edit the file to enter our script commands, alternatively use vim test-script.sh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # !/ usr / bin / expect set timeout 1 send \"passwd USER\\n\" expect \"Password: \" send \"password\\n\" sleep 1 interact First we tell the operating system what program (environment platform) will actually be able to read and execute the instructions (normally linux uses BASH /bin/bash but in this case it's EXPECT). Setting the timeout means that we will wait at least and at most 1 second before a non responding command is skipped to execute the next command. Send tells the operating system something (e.g. we want to run the change USER's password program) The expect command tells the script to wait for the operating system to prompt the user to type in a password. Once the operating system responds (with exactly what we \"expected\") the script continues by sending (just as if a user typed it in) some predetermined password picked by the script writer. Finally we tell our script to sleep for one second after all of it's hard work. Oh, and it's very important to \"interact\" , which returns the command prompt back to the user/operating system. Whew... that's just the tip of the iceberg of how \"expect\" greatly extends the functionality of Linux scripts! Later I hope to demonstrate some VBScript (for windows) and maybe even a script on how to run a \"non interactive FTP session\" (as most FTP programs require \"interaction\" aka human at the keyboard)...","tags":"linux","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/script-programming-linux-expect-script-passwd-365-programming-project-day-twenty-two/"},{"title":"Windows programming in WinCE on an HP IPAQ: 365 programming project day twenty one","text":"As the number of portable computers (we might call them mobile phones or smart phones or pda's etc.) explodes they need software.

Futher exploration of the theme of PHP + CSS + HTML as a very simple way to get user input and then do something fun with it. The beginnings of trying to \"modularize\" code into functions earlier in the process (in later, more complex programs it is a necessity). You may be asking, \"How is this useful?\" but I think it's a popular misconception that Programs should be useful... I will try to break the code into chunks (that you will have to re-assemble) but with better piece by piece explanation: Defining CSS Style in the Head Best practice is to have many php or html pages linked to a single CSS definition file so that a single update is more efficient. Efficiency in this case means all of the code in one easily visible file. The CSS here removes the anchor (hyperlink) underline and makes it black BUT if hovered the text will turn red. < html >< head > < style type = \"text/css\" > <! -- removing text decoration removes the underlines -- > # chosen a { text-decoration : none ; color : black ; } # chosen a : hover { text-decoration : none ; color : red ; } </ style ></ head > Body of PHP functions If you have an HTML head then you should have a body. The majority of the body is the definition of a custom function called \"display_board\". Again I'm using the trick that if the user has entered data (and therefore something's in the $_POST) then we get to show the user that we've done something fun with what they gave us. PHP functions are easy to define and have the usual parameters and return value responsibilities (though parameters don't need any typing which allows the programmer to focus on the concepts, not the implementation - hopefully not confusing the variables up in the process). Much like a CSS you can have a file with the definitions of your php functions and include it somewhere with include(\"footer.php\"); On one hand you remove the implementation details which can make prototyping and modularization faster and easier, on the other hand you have to search through/open a number of different files (or even include definitions to functions you don't use) and of course, it's great to ignore the implentation details right until something goes wrong. function display_board <body>Click on one square, then submit, then hover your choice!<br /> <br /> <?php function display_board ( $chosen_square ) { print '<form action=\"' . $_SERVER [ 'PHP_SELF' ] . '\" method=\"post\">' ; print \" \\n \" ; //newline character in the HTML code for readability print '<div id=\"chosen\" align=\"center\"\\>' ; print \" \\n \" ; I don't think the indentations show up well in the blog but the nested loops and formula are just a fancy way of counting from 1 to 64 with 8 items per line. The magic \"redefined css anchor\" is buried in there if the user has chosen a square. nested for loops for($x=0; $x<8; $x++) { for($y=0; $y<8; $y++) { if( ((8*$x) + $y+1) == $chosen_square ) { print '<input type=\"radio\" name=\"board_square\" value=\"'; print ((8*$x) + $y+1) . '\">'; print '<a href=\"#\"> '; print ((8*$x) + $y+1); print \"</a>\\n\"; //the nested for loops formula creates 64 consecutive values } else { print '<input type=\"radio\" name=\"board_square\" value=\"'; print ((8*$x) + $y+1) . '\"> ' . ((8*$x) + $y+1) . \"\\n\"; } } print \"<br \\>\\n\"; } print '</div><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Press Me\" /></form>'; user input stripslashes is best practice when dealing with user data though I'm not sure how a $_POST of a radio button value could end up as a root command; better safe than sorry. The ever present \"if the $_POST variable is set AND the $chosen_square variable is NOT EMPTY\" allows to only print something that exists (instead of foolishly printing non-existent stuff). Finally we call our function (with a parameter). So if the CSS and PHP function definition were other files this \"program\" would be very compact and very easy to read (but then again you wouldn't know what the program did unless you had those other files). $chosen_square = stripslashes( $_POST['board_square'] ); if( !empty( $chosen_square ) && isset( $chosen_square ) ) { print $chosen_square; } display_board( $chosen_square ); ?> </body> </html>","tags":"programming","url":"https://blog.john-pfeiffer.com/php-and-css-on-a-radio-button-board-365-programming-project-day-five/"},{"title":"First real Windows program: 365 programming project day four","text":"Windows Programming has a steep curve in the beginning as there are many things to memorize (oops I mean learn and understand) as theoretically they've created the data structures and functions to get stuff on the screen.

Writing a script to install something is ok, installing something by choosing menu options is not. It can be on any platform or hardware Windows, Linux, WinCE, Android, laptop, desktop, server, virtual machine, phone, etc. Building up little pieces into a larger one is ok, in fact it's not only Programming best practice but one of the goals of the whole project (shhh... to be revealed at the end!)

WHERE TO PUT YOUR KEYWORDS (and synonyms of keywords) Url: use hyphens instead of spaces... Title: Unique per page (65 chars at most) Description (no stop/common words - but this is what Google will display so it's like an Ad!)

BUT every link away from your page could be considered a \"vote\" that another page is more important... especially avoid links to other sites (without a good reason).
